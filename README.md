## Running locally

If you are going to contribute often to the documentation it is best to create your own fork, clone it to your local machine. 

Once it is cloned to you machine, install the node dependencies with:

```sh
npm install
```

then start the local server with:

```sh
npm run start
```

This will respond with:
```sh
