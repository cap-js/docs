## What is CAP?

The _Cloud Application Programming Model_ (CAP) is a framework of languages, libraries, and tools for building *enterprise-grade* cloud applications. It guides developers along a *golden path* of proven [best practices](#enterprise-best-practices), served [out-of-the-box](#served-out-of-the-box), and hence greatly reduces boilerplate code and tedious recurring tasks.

In effect, CAP-based projects benefit from a primary [focus on domain](#focus-on-domain) in close collaboration with domain experts, and from [accelerated development](#grow-as-you-go) at minimised costs. CAP's *agnostic design* shields developers from overly technical disciplines, and fosters [evolution w/o disruption]() in a world of rapidly changing technologies.

## Avoiding Technical Dept

There's a nice definition of technical dept found at this [glossary by ProductPlan](https://www.productplan.com/glossary/technical-debt/):

*"Technical debt (also known as tech debt or code debt) describes what results when development teams take actions to expedite the delivery of a piece of functionality or a project which later needs to be refactored [or fixed]. In other words, it’s the result of prioritizing speedy delivery over perfect code."* {.indent style="font-family:serif"}

So, how could CAP help to avoid — or reduce risks of — piling up technical debt?
