### Annotating Service Entities

\(cursor position indicated by `|`\)

1.  Place cursor in the `annotate` directive for a service entity, for example `annotate Foo.Bar with ;` and trigger the code completion.
2.  Type `u` to filter the suggestions and choose `{} UI`. Micro-snippet `@UI : {|}` is inserted: `annotate Foo.Bar with @UI : {|};`
3.  Use the code completion again to add an annotation term from UI vocabulary, in this example `SelectionFields`. Micro snippet for this annotation is added and the cursor is placed right after the term name letting you define a qualifier: `annotate Foo.Bar with @UI : {SelectionFields : [|]};`
4.  Press the **Tab** key to move the cursor to the next tab stop and use the code completion again to add values. As `UI.SelectionFields` annotation is a collection of entity elements \(entity properties\), all elements of the annotated entity are suggested.

*Note:* To choose an element of an associated entity, first select the corresponding association from the list and type *. \(period\)*. Elements of associated entity are suggested.

*Note:* You can add multiple values separated by comma.

#### Sample Code


 ```cds
        annotate Foo.Bar with @UI : { SelectionFields : [
            description, assignedIndividual.lastName|
            ]
         };
   ```

5.  Add `, (comma)` after collection brackets **\[\]** and use the code completion again to add another annotation from UI vocabulary, such as `LineItem`. Line item is a collection of DataField records. To add a record, select the record type you need from the completion list.


#### Sample Code

 ```
        annotate Foo.Bar with @UI : { SelectionFields : [
            description, assignedIndividual.lastName
            ],
            LineItem : [
                {
                    $Type:'UI.DataField',
                    Value : |,
                },
                ]

         };

  ```
*Note:* For each record type, two kinds of micro-snippets are provided: one containing only mandatory properties and one containing all properties defined for this record \(full record\). Usually you need just a subset of properties. So, you either select a full record and then remove the properties you donâ€™t need, or add the record containing only required properties and then add the remaining properties.

6.  Use code completion to add values for the annotation properties.

#### Sample Code

 ```cds
        annotate Foo.Bar with @UI : { SelectionFields : [
            description, assignedIndividual.lastName
            ],
            LineItem : [
                {
                    $Type:'UI.DataField',
                    Value : description,
                },
                {
                    $Type:'UI.DataFieldForAnnotation',
                    Target :  'assignedIndividual/@Communication.Contact',
                },|
              ]
               };

    ```

*Note:* To add values pointing to annotations defined in another CDS source, you must reference this source with \`using\` directive.
