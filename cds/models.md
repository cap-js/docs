# On The Nature of Models

{{ $frontmatter.synopsis }}


## Metaphysics of Languages

A *model* is a *thing* that describes *something*.
For example, a *data model describes the type structure (commonly also called *'schema*') of *data*.

### Languages

### Representations

Models can come in different *representations*, which follow different *syntaxes*. For example, we use the *CDL* syntax for *human-readable* representations of CDS models, while CSN is an *object notation*, i.e. a special form of *syntax*, used for *machine-readable* representations of CDS models. 

::: details On CSN representations... 

We can go one meta-level further and distinguish between different representations of CSN representations: in a Node.js process at runtime they are just native in-memory JavaScript objects, when shared they are serialized to JSON format, which can in turn be translated to YAML, and so forth. When we create CSN objects at runtime, they could be plain JavaScript code. 

:::

### Reflections

CDS models can be compiled to other languages, that play in the same fields, yet not covering the same information, but rather with some loss of information — we call these '*reflections*'. 

Examples are:

- SQL DDL covers the persistence model interface only → only flat tables and views
- OData EDMX covers the service interfaces only → queryable entities still exist, with implicit features
- GraqhQL also covers service interfaces → queryable entities still exist, but without less features
- OpenAPI also covers the service interfaces, with → queryable entities got 'flattened' to paths with input and output types

---

The above principles apply not only to CDS models, but also to Queries:

- CQL is a syntax for human-readable representations
- CQN is an object notation for machine-readable representations

And for Expressions:

- CXL is a syntax for human-readable representations
- CXN is an object notation for machine-readable representations

...




## What is a CDS Model?

Models in `cds` are plain JavaScript objects conforming to the _[Core Schema Notation (CSN)](./csn)_. They can be parsed from [_.cds_ sources](./cdl), read from _.json_ or _.yaml_ files or dynamically created in code at runtime.

The following ways and examples of creating models are equivalent:

### In Plain Coding at Runtime

```js
const cds = require('@sap/cds')

// define the model
var model = {definitions:{
    Products: {kind:'entity', elements:{
        ID: {type:'Integer', key:true},
        title: {type:'String', length:11, localized:true},
        description: {type:'String', localized:true},
    }},
    Orders: {kind:'entity', elements:{
        product: {type:'Association', target:'Products'},
        quantity: {type:'Integer'},
    }},
}}

// do something with it
console.log (cds.compile.to.yaml (model))
```


### Parsed at Runtime

```js
const cds = require('@sap/cds')

// define the model
var model = cds.parse (`
    entity Products {
        key ID: Integer;
        title: localized String(11);
        description: localized String;
    }
    entity Orders {
        product: Association to Products;
        quantity: Integer;
    }
`)

// do something with it
console.log (cds.compile.to.yaml (model))
```


### From _.cds_ Source Files

```cds
// some.cds source file
entity Products {
    key ID: Integer;
    title: localized String(11);
    description: localized String;
}
entity Orders {
    product: Association to Products;
    quantity: Integer;
}
```

Read/parse it, and do something with it, for example:

```js
const cds = require('@sap/cds')
cds.get('./some.cds') .then (cds.compile.to.yaml) .then (console.log)
```

> Which is equivalent to: `cds ./some.cds -2 yaml` using the CLI


### From _.json_ Files

```json
{"definitions": {
    "Products": {
        "kind": "entity",
        "elements": {
            "ID": { "type": "Integer", "key": true },
            "title": { "type": "String", "length": 11, "localized": true },
            "description": { "type": "String", "localized": true }
        }
    },
    "Orders": {
        "kind": "entity",
        "elements": {
            "product": { "type": "Association", "target": "Products" },
            "quantity": { "type": "Integer" }
        }
    }
}}
```

```js
const cds = require('@sap/cds')
cds.get('./some.json') .then (cds.compile.to.yaml) .then (console.log)
```

<div id="beforefrontends" />

### From Other Frontends

You can add any other frontend instead of using [CDL](./cdl); it's just about generating the respective [CSN](./csn) structures, most easily as _.json_. For example, different parties already added these frontends:

* ABAP CDS 2 csn
* OData EDMX 2 csn
* Fiori annotation.xml 2 csn
* i18n properties files 2 csn
* Java/JPA models 2 csn


## Processing Models

All model processing and compilation steps, which can be applied subsequently just work on the basis of plain CSN objects. There's no assumption about and no lock-in to a specific source format.
