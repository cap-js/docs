# Getting Started
Your First Steps {.subtitle}

Welcome to CAP, and to *capire*, its one-stop documentation.

[**CAP** [ˈkap(m)] — (unofficial) abbreviation for the *"SAP Cloud Application Programming Model"*](https://translate.google.com/details?sl=en&text=cap){.learn-more .dict}

[**capire** [ca·pì·re] — Italian for _"understand"_](https://translate.google.com/details?sl=it&tl=en&text=capire){.learn-more .dict}

## Initial Setup {#setup}

Follow the steps below for a minimalistic local setup. Alternatively, you can use CAP in [SAP Build Code](https://pages.community.sap.com/topics/build-code), or other cloud-based setups, such as GitHub codespaces.



#### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) — required for installing the `cds` command line interface.
- [SQLite](https://sqlite.org) — included in macOS and Linux → [install it](https://sqlite.org/download.html) on Windows.
- **A Terminal**{style="font-weight: 500"} — for using the `cds` command line interface (CLI)
- **A Text Editor**{style="font-weight: 500"} → we recommend [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) with [CDS plugin](/tools(/cds/editors#vscode).


#### Installation

- With the prerequisites met, install the [`cds` toolkit](/tools(/cds/cli) *globally*:

    ```sh
    npm add -g @sap(/cds/dk
    ```

    [Visit the _Troubleshooting_ guide](troubleshooting.md) if you encounter any errors. {.learn-more}

- Run `cds` to check whether installation was successful:

  ```sh
  cds
  ```

  which should yield some output like that:

  ```sh
  USAGE
  
      cds <command> [<args>]
      cds <src>  =  cds compile <src>
      cds        =  cds help
  
  COMMANDS
  
      i | init        jump-start cds-based projects
      a | add         add a feature to an existing project
      c | compile     compile cds models to different outputs
      s | serve       run your services in local server
      w | watch       run and restart on file changes
      r | repl        read-eval-event loop
      e | env         inspect effective configuration
      b | build       prepare for deployment
      d | deploy      deploy to databases or cloud
      v | version     get detailed version information
      ? | help        get detailed usage information
  
    Learn more about each command using:
    cds help <command> or
    cds <command> --help
  
  ```



#### Optional

- [Java](https://sapmachine.io) & [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) — if you're going for Java development → [see instructions](/java/getting-started#local).
- [git](https://git-scm.com) — if you go for more than just some quick trials...



## Starting Projects

- Use `cds init` to start a CAP project, ... then open it in VSCode:

   ```sh
   cds init bookshop
   ```

   ```sh
   code bookshop
   ```
   [Assumes you activated the `code` command on macOS as documented](/tools(/cds/editors#vscode) {.learn-more}



## Project Structure

The default file structure of CAP projects is as follows:

```zsh
bookshop/        # Your project's root folder
├─ app/          # UI-related content
├─ srv/          # Service-related content
├─ db/           # Domain models and database-related content
├─ package.json  # Configuration for cds + cds-dk
└─ readme.md     # A readme placeholder
```

CAP has defaults for many things that you'd have to configure in other frameworks. The goal is that things should just work out of the box, with zero configuration, whenever possible. You can override these [defaults by specific configuration](/node.js(/cds/env) if you need to do so.

::: details See an example for configuring custom project layouts...

::: code-group

```json [package.json]
{ ...
  "cds": {
    "folders": {
       "db": "database/",
       "srv": "services/",
       "app": "uis/"
    }
  }
}
```

:::

::: tip Convention over configuration
We recommend to stick to CAP's way of [Convention over Configuration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_over_configuration) to benefit from things just working out of the  box. Only override the defaults if you really need to do so.

To explore the defaults in your projects do as follows:
```sh
cds env ls defaults
```
