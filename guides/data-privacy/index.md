## Introduction to Data Privacy


Data protection is associated with numerous legal requirements and privacy concerns, such as the EU's [General Data Protection Regulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation). In addition to compliance with general data protection and privacy acts regarding [personal data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_data), you need to consider compliance with industry-specific legislation in different countries/regions.

CAP supports applications in their obligations to comply to data privacy regulations, by automating tedious tasks as much as possible based on annotated models. That is, CAP provides easy ways to designate personal data, as well as out-of-the-box integration with SAP BTP services, which enable you to fulfill specific data privacy requirements in your application. This greatly relieves application developers these tedious tasks and related efforts.

### In a Nutshell

The most essential requests you have to answer are those in the following table. The table also shows the basis of the requirement and the corresponding discipline for the request:

| Question / Request                          | Obligation                                      | Solution                            |
| ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| *What data about me do you have stored?*    | [Right of access](#right-of-access)             | [Personal Data Management](pdm.md)  |
| *Please delete all personal data about me!* | [Right to be forgotten](#right-to-be-forgotten) | [Data Retention Management](drm.md) |
| *When was personal data stored/changed?*    | [Transparency](#transparency)                   | [Audit Logging](audit-logging.md)   |

## Annotating Personal Data

The first and frequently only task to do as an application developer is to identify entities and elements (potentially) holding personal data using `@PersonalData` annotations. These are used to automate CAP-facilitated audit logging, personal data management, and data retention management as much as possible.

## Automatic Audit Logging {#transparency}

The **Transparancy** obligation, requests to be able to report with whom data stored about an individual is shared and where that came from (e.g., [EU GDPR Article 15(1)(c,g)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:02016R0679-20160504&qid=1692819634946#tocId22)).

The [SAP Audit Log Service](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/audit-logging-in-cloud-foundry-environment) stores all audit logs for a tenant in a common, compliant data store and allows auditors to search through and retrieve the respective logs when necessary.

## Personal Data Management { #right-of-access }

The [**Right of Access** to personal data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_of_access_to_personal_data) "gives people the right to access their personal data and information about how this personal data is being processed".

The [SAP Personal Data Manager](https://help.sap.com/docs/personal-data-manager?locale=en-US) allows you to inform individuals about the data you have stored regarding them.

[Learn more in the *Personal Data Management* guide](pdm) {.learn-more}



## Data Retention Management { #right-to-be-forgotten }

The [**Right to be Forgotten**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_be_forgotten) gives people "the right to request erasure of personal data related to them on any one of a number of grounds [...]".

The [SAP Data Retention Manager](https://help.sap.com/docs/data-retention-manager?locale=en-US) allows you to manage retention and residence rules to block or destroy personal data.
