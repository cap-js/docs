# Using SQLite for Development {#sqlite}

CAP provides extensive support for [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html), which allows projects to speed up development by magnitudes at minimized costs. We strongly recommend using this option as much as possible during development and testing.

<div markdown="1" class="impl node">

::: tip New SQLite Service
This guide focuses on the new SQLite Service provided through *[@cap-js/sqlite](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cap-js/sqlite)*, which has many advantages over the former one, as documented in the [*Features*](#features) section. To migrate from the old service, find instructions in the [*Migration*](#migration) section.

## Setup & Configuration

<div markdown="1" class="impl node">

Run this to use SQLite for development:

```sh
npm add @cap-js/sqlite -D
```

### Auto-Wired Configuration {.impl .node}

The `@cap-js/sqlite` package uses the `cds-plugin` technique to auto-configure your application for using an in-memory SQLite database for development.

You can inspect the effective configuration using `cds env`:

```sh
cds env requires.db
```

Output:

```js
{
  impl: '@cap-js/sqlite',
  credentials: { url: ':memory:' },
  kind: 'sqlite'
}
```

[See also the general information on installing database packages.](databases#setup-configuration){.learn-more}

</div>


### Using the Maven Archetype {.impl .java}

When a new CAP Java project is created with the [Maven Archetype](../java/development/#the-maven-archetype),
you can specify the in-memory database to be used. Use the option `-DinMemoryDatabase=sqlite` to create a project that uses
SQLite as in-memory database.

### Manual Configuration {.impl .java}

To use SQLite, add a Maven dependency to the SQLite JDBC driver:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.xerial</groupId>
  <artifactId>sqlite-jdbc</artifactId>
  <scope>runtime</scope>
</dependency>
```

Further configuration depends on whether you run SQLite as an [in-memory database](#in-memory-databases) or as a [file-based](#persistent-databases) database.

## Deployment

### In-Memory Databases

<div markdown="1" class="impl node">


As stated previously, `@cap-js/sqlite` uses an in-memory SQLite database by default. For example, when starting your application with `cds watch`, you can see this in the log output:

```log
...
[cds] - connect to db > sqlite { url: ':memory:' } //[!code focus]
  > init from db/init.js
  > init from db/data/sap.capire.bookshop-Authors.csv
  > init from db/data/sap.capire.bookshop-Books.csv
  > init from db/data/sap.capire.bookshop-Books.texts.csv
  > init from db/data/sap.capire.bookshop-Genres.csv
/> successfully deployed to in-memory database. //[!code focus]
...
```

::: tip

Using in-memory databases is the most recommended option for test drives and test pipelines.

:::

</div>

<div markdown="1" class="impl java">


The database content is stored in-memory. [Configure the build](../java/persistence-services#initial-database-schema-1) to create an initial _schema.sql_ file for SQLite using `cds deploy --to sqlite --dry > srv/src/main/resources/schema.sql`.

Finally, configure the DB connection in the non-productive `default` profile:

```yaml
---
spring:
  config.activate.on-profile: default
  sql:
    init:
      mode: always
  datasource:
    url: "jdbc:sqlite:file::memory:?cache=shared"
    driver-class-name: org.sqlite.JDBC
    hikari:
      maximum-pool-size: 1
      max-lifetime: 0
```

</div>

### Persistent Databases

<!--
TODO: A plain cds.requires.db = 'sqlite' also behaves this way.
If possible, all common scenarios should be covered by shortcuts only.
-->

<div markdown="1" class="impl node">


You can also use persistent SQLite databases. Follow these steps to do so:

</div>

<div markdown="1" class="impl java">


You can also use persistent SQLite databases. In this case, the schema is initialized by `cds deploy` and not by Spring. Follow these steps:

</div>

1. Specify a database filename in your `db` configuration as follows:

   ::: code-group

   ```json [package.json]
   { "cds": { "requires": {
      "db": {
         "kind": "sqlite",
         "credentials": { "url": "db.sqlite" } //[!code focus]
      }
   }}}
   ```

   :::

2. Run `cds deploy`:

   ```sh
   cds deploy
   ```

This will:

1. Create a database file with the given name.
2. Create the tables and views according to your CDS model.
3. Fill in initial data from the provided _.csv_ files.

<div markdown="1" class="impl node">


With that in place, the server will use this prepared database instead of bootstrapping an in-memory one upon startup:

```log
...
[cds] - connect to db > sqlite { url: 'db.sqlite' }
...
```

</div>

<div markdown="1" class="impl java">


Finally, configure the DB connection - ideally in a dedicated `sqlite` profile:

```yaml
---
spring:
  config.activate.on-profile: sqlite
  datasource:
    url: "jdbc:sqlite:sqlite.db"
    driver-class-name: org.sqlite.JDBC
    hikari:
      maximum-pool-size: 1
```

</div>

::: tip Redeploy on changes

Remember to always redeploy your database whenever you change your models or your data. Just run `cds deploy` again to do so.

:::

### Drop-Create Schema

When you redeploy your database, it will always drop-create all tables and views. This is **most suitable for development environments**, where schema changes are very frequent and broad.

### Schema Evolution

While drop-create is most appropriate for development, it isn't suitable for database upgrades in production, as all customer data would be lost. To avoid this, `cds deploy` also supports automatic schema evolution, which you can use as follows:

1. Enable automatic schema evolution in your `db` configuration:

   ::: code-group

   ```json [package.json]
   { "cds": { "requires": {
      "db": {
         "kind": "sqlite",
         "credentials": { "url": "db.sqlite" },
         "schema_evolution": "auto" //[!code focus]
      }
   }}}
   ```

   :::

2. Run `cds deploy`:

   ```sh
   cds deploy
   ```

## Features

<div markdown="1" class="impl java">

CAP supports most of the major features on SQLite:

* [Path Expressions](../java/query-api#path-expressions) & Filters
* [Expands](../java/query-api#projections)
* [Localized Queries](../guides/localized-data#read-operations)
* [Comparison Operators](../java/query-api#comparison-operators)
* [Predicate Functions](../java/query-api#predicate-functions)

[Learn about features and limitations of SQLite.](../java/persistence-services#sqlite){.learn-more}

</div>

<div markdown="1" class="impl node">

The following is an overview of advanced features supported by the new database services.

> These apply to all new database services, including SQLiteService, HANAService, and PostgresService.



### Path Expressions & Filters {.impl .node}

The new database service provides **full support** for all kinds of [path expressions](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/cds/cql#path-expressions), including [infix filters](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/cds/cql#with-infix-filters) and [exists predicates](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/cds/cql#exists-predicate). For example, you can try this out with *[cap/samples](https://github.com/sap-samples/cloud-cap-samples)* as follows:

```sh
cds repl --profile better-sqlite
var { server } = await cds.test('bookshop'), { Books, Authors } = cds.entities
await INSERT.into (Books) .entries ({ title: 'Unwritten Book' })
await INSERT.into (Authors) .entries ({ name: 'Upcoming Author' })
await SELECT `from ${Books} { title as book, author.name as author, genre.name as genre }`
await SELECT `from ${Authors} { books.title as book, name as author, books.genre.name as genre }`
await SELECT `from ${Books} { title as book, author[ID<170].name as author, genre.name as genre }`
await SELECT `from ${Books} { title as book, author.name as author, genre.name as genre }` .where ({'author.name':{like:'Ed%'},or:{'author.ID':170}})
await SELECT `from ${Books} { title as book, author.name as author, genre.name as genre } where author.name like 'Ed%' or author.ID=170`
await SELECT `from ${Books}:author[name like 'Ed%' or ID=170] { books.title as book, name as author, books.genre.name as genre }`
await SELECT `from ${Books}:author[150] { books.title as book, name as author, books.genre.name as genre }`
await SELECT `from ${Authors} { ID, name, books { ID, title }}`
await SELECT `from ${Authors} { ID, name, books { ID, title, genre { ID, name }}}`
await SELECT `from ${Authors} { ID, name, books.genre { ID, name }}`
await SELECT `from ${Authors} { ID, name, books as some_books { ID, title, genre.name as genre }}`
await SELECT `from ${Authors} { ID, name, books[genre.ID=11] as dramatic_books { ID, title, genre.name as genre }}`
await SELECT `from ${Authors} { ID, name, books.genre[name!='Drama'] as no_drama_books_count { count(*) as sum }}`
await SELECT `from ${Authors} { books.genre.ID }`
await SELECT `from ${Authors} { books.genre }`
await SELECT `from ${Authors} { books.genre.name }`

```



### Optimized Expands {.impl .node}

The old database service implementation(s) used to translate deep reads, that is, SELECTs with expands, into several database queries and collect the individual results into deep result structures. The new service uses `json_object` and other similar functions to instead do that in one single query, with sub selects, which greatly improves performance.

For example:

```sql
SELECT.from(Authors, a => {
  a.ID, a.name, a.books (b => {
    b.title, b.genre (g => {
       g.name
    })
  })
})
```

While this used to require three queries with three roundtrips to the database, now only one query is required.





### Localized Queries {.impl .node}

With the old implementation, running queries like `SELECT.from(Books)` would always return localized data, without being able to easily read the non-localized data. The new service does only what you asked for, offering new `SELECT.localized` options:

```js
let books = await SELECT.from(Books)       //> non-localized data
let lbooks = await SELECT.localized(Books) //> localized data
```

Usage variants include:

```js
SELECT.localized(Books)
SELECT.from.localized(Books)
SELECT.one.localized(Books)
```



### Standard Operators {.impl .node}

The new database services guarantee identical behavior of these logic operators:

- `==`, `=` — with `= null` being translated to `is null`
- `!=`,  `<>`  — with `!=` translated to `IS NOT` in SQLite

* `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `IN`, `LIKE` — are supported as is in standard SQL

In particular, the translation of `!=` to `IS NOT` in SQLite — or to `IS DISTINCT FROM` in standard SQL, or to an equivalent polyfill in SAP HANA — greatly improves the portability of your code.



### Standard Functions {.impl .node}

A specified set of standard functions is now supported in a **database-agnostic**, hence portable way, and translated to database-specific variants or polyfills. These functions are by and large the same as specified in OData:

* `concat(x,y,...)` — concatenates the given strings
* `contains(x,y)` — checks whether `y` is contained in `x`, may be fuzzy
* `search(xs,y)` — checks whether `y` is contained in any of `xs`, may be fuzzy
* `startswith(x,y)` — checks whether `y` starts with `x`
* `endswith(x,y)` — checks whether `y` ends with `x`
* `matchesPattern(x,y)` — checks whether `x` matches regex `y`
* `substring(x,i,n)` — extracts a substring from `x` starting at `i` with length `n` <sup>1</sup>
* `indexof(x,y)` — returns the (zero-based) index of the first occurrence of `y` in `x`
* `length(x)` — returns the length of string `x`
* `tolower(x)` — returns all-lowercased `x`
* `toupper(x)` — returns all-uppercased `x`
* `ceiling(x)` — returns ceiled `x`
* `session_context(v)` — with standard variable names → [see below](#session-variables)
* `year` `month`, `day`, `hour`, `minute`, `second` — return parts of a datetime

> <sup>1</sup> Argument `n` is optional.

The database service implementation translates these to the best-possible native SQL functions, thus enhancing the extent of **portable** queries.

CQL query:

```sql
SELECT from Books where search((title,descr),'y')
```

Translated native SQLite query:

```sql
SELECT * from sap_capire_bookshop_Books
 WHERE ifnull(instr(lower(title),lower('y')),0)
    OR ifnull(instr(lower(descr),lower('y')),0)
```

> Note: only single values are supported for the second argument `y`.

::: warning Case-sensitive

You have to write these functions exactly as given; all-uppercase usages aren't supported.

:::



### SAP HANA Functions {.impl .node}

In addition to the standard functions, which all new database services support, the new SQLite service also supports these common SAP HANA functions, to further increase the scope for portable testing:

- `years_between`
- `months_between`
- `days_between`
- `seconds_between`
- `nano100_between`

With open source and the new database service architecture, we also have methods in place to enhance this list by custom implementation.

> Both usages are allowed here: all-lowercase as given above, as well as all-uppercase.





### Session Variables {.impl .node}

The new SQLite service can leverage  [*better-sqlite*](https://www.npmjs.com/package/better-sqlite3)'s user-defined functions to support *session context* variables. In particular, the pseudo variables `$user.id`, `$user.locale`,  `$valid.from`, and `$valid.to` are available in native SQL queries as shown below:

```sql
SELECT session_context('$user.id')
SELECT session_context('$user.locale')
SELECT session_context('$valid.from')
SELECT session_context('$valid.to')
```

Among other things, this allows us to get rid of static helper views for localized data like `localized_de_sap_capire_Books`.

::: tip Portable API

The API shown below, which includes the function `session_context()` and specific pseudo variable names, is supported by **all** new database services, that is, *SQLite*, *PostgreSQL* and *SAP HANA*. This allows you to write respective code once and run it on all these databases.

:::



### Using Lean Draft {.impl .node}

The old implementation was overly polluted with draft handling. But as draft is actually a Fiori UI concept, none of that should show up in database layers. Hence, we eliminated all draft handling from the new database service implementations, and implemented draft in a modular, non-intrusive way — called *'Lean Draft'*. The most important change is that we don't do expensive UNIONs anymore but work with single (cheap) selects.



### Consistent Timestamps {.impl .node}

Values for elements of type `DateTime`  and `Timestamp` are handled in a consistent way across all new database services along these lines:

:::tip *Timestamps* = `Timestamp` as well as `DateTime`

When we say *Timestamps*, we mean elements of type `Timestamp` as well as `DateTime`. Although they have different precision levels, they are essentially the same type. `DateTime` elements have seconds precision, while `Timestamp` elements have milliseconds precision in SQLite, and microsecond precision in SAP HANA and PostgreSQL.

:::



#### Writing Timestamps

When writing data using INSERT, UPSERT or UPDATE, you can provide values for `DateTime` and `Timestamp` elements as JavaScript  `Date` objects or ISO 8601 Strings. All input is normalized to ensure `DateTime` and `Timestamp` values can be safely compared. In case of SAP HANA and PostgreSQL, they're converted to native types. In case of SQLite, they're stored as ISO 8601 Strings in Zulu timezone as returned by JavaScript's `Date.toISOString()`.

For example:

```js
await INSERT.into(Books).entries([
  { createdAt: new Date },                       //> stored .toISOString()
  { createdAt: '2022-11-11T11:11:11Z' },         //> padded with .000Z
  { createdAt: '2022-11-11T11:11:11.123Z' },     //> stored as is
  { createdAt: '2022-11-11T11:11:11.1234563Z' }, //> truncated to .123Z
  { createdAt: '2022-11-11T11:11:11+02:00' },    //> converted to zulu time
])
```



#### Reading Timestamps

Timestamps are returned as they're stored in a normalized way, with milliseconds precision, as supported by the JavaScript `Date` object. For example, the entries inserted previously would return the following:

```js
await SELECT('createdAt').from(Books).where({title:null})
```

```js
[
  { createdAt: '2023-08-10T14:24:30.798Z' },
  { createdAt: '2022-11-11T11:11:11.000Z' },
  { createdAt: '2022-11-11T11:11:11.123Z' },
  { createdAt: '2022-11-11T11:11:11.123Z' },
  { createdAt: '2022-11-11T09:11:11.000Z' }
]
```

`DateTime` elements are returned with seconds precision, with all fractional second digits truncated. That is, if the `createdAt` in our examples was a `DateTime`, the previous query would return this:

```js
[
  { createdAt: '2023-08-10T14:24:30Z' },
  { createdAt: '2022-11-11T11:11:11Z' },
  { createdAt: '2022-11-11T11:11:11Z' },
  { createdAt: '2022-11-11T11:11:11Z' },
  { createdAt: '2022-11-11T09:11:11Z' }
]
```



#### Comparing DateTimes & Timestamps

You can safely compare DateTimes & Timestamps with each other and with input values. The input values have to be `Date` objects or ISO 8601 Strings in Zulu timezone with three fractional digits.

For example, all of these would work:

```js
SELECT.from(Foo).where `someTimestamp = anotherTimestamp`
SELECT.from(Foo).where `someTimestamp = someDateTime`
SELECT.from(Foo).where `someTimestamp = ${new Date}`
SELECT.from(Foo).where `someTimestamp = ${req.timestamp}`
SELECT.from(Foo).where `someTimestamp = ${'2022-11-11T11:11:11.123Z'}`
```

While these would fail, because the input values don't comply to the rules:

```js
SELECT.from(Foo).where `createdAt = ${'2022-11-11T11:11:11+02:00'}` // non-Zulu time zone
SELECT.from(Foo).where `createdAt = ${'2022-11-11T11:11:11Z'}` // missing 3-digit fractions
```

> This is because we can never reliably infer the types of input to `where` clause expressions. Therefore, that input will not receive any normalisation, but be passed down as is as plain string.

:::tip Always ensure proper input in `where` clauses

Either use strings strictly in `YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.fffZ` format, or `Date` objects, as follows:

```js
SELECT.from(Foo).where ({ createdAt: '2022-11-11T11:11:11.000Z' })
SELECT.from(Foo).where ({ createdAt: new Date('2022-11-11T11:11:11Z') })
```

:::

The rules regarding Timestamps apply to all comparison operators: `=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`.



### Improved Performance {.impl .node}

The combination of the above-mentioned improvements commonly leads to significant performance improvements. For example, displaying the list page of Travels in [cap/sflight](https://github.com/SAP-samples/cap-sflight) took **>250ms** in the past, and **~15ms** now.





## Migration {.impl .node}



While we were able to keep all public APIs stable, we had to apply changes and fixes to some **undocumented behaviours and internal APIs** in the new implementation. While not formally breaking changes, you may have used or relied on these undocumented APIs and behaviours. In that case, you can find instructions about how to resolve this in the following sections.

> These apply to all new database services: SQLiteService, HANAService, and PostgresService.



### Use Old and New in Parallel {.impl .node}

During migration, you may want to occasionally run and test your app with both the new SQLite service and the old one. You can accomplish this as follows:

1. Add the new service with `--no-save`:
   ```sh
   npm add @cap-js/sqlite --no-save
   ```

   > This bypasses the *cds-plugin* mechanism, which works through package dependencies.

2. Run or test your app with the `better-sqlite` profile using one of these options:

   ```sh
   cds watch bookshop --profile better-sqlite
   ```

   ```sh
   CDS_ENV=better-sqlite cds watch bookshop
   ```

   ```sh
   CDS_ENV=better-sqlite jest --silent
   ```

3. Run or test your app with the old SQLite service as before:
   ```sh
   cds watch bookshop
   ```
   ```sh
   jest --silent
   ```


### Avoid UNIONs and JOINs {.impl .node}

Many advanced features supported by the new database services, like path expressions or deep expands, rely on the ability to infer queries from CDS models. This task gets extremely complex when adding UNIONs and JOINs to the equation — at least the effort and overhead is hardly matched by generated value. Therefore, we dropped support of UNIONs and JOINs in CQN queries.

For example, this means queries like these are deprecated / not supported any longer:

```js
SELECT.from(Books).join(Authors,...)
```

Mitigations:

1. Use [path expressions](#path-expressions-filters) instead of joins. (The former lack of support for path expressions was the most common reason for having to use joins at all.)

2. Use plain SQL queries like so:

   ```js
   await db.run(`SELECT from ${Books} join ${Authors} ...`)
   ```

3. Use helper views modeled in CDS, which still supports all complex UNIONs and JOINs, then use this view via `cds.ql`.





### Fixed Localized Data {.impl .node}

Formerly, when reading data using `cds.ql`, this *always* returned localized data. For example:

```js
SELECT.from(Books)       // always read from localized.Books instead
```

This wasn't only wrong, but also expensive. Localized data is an application layer concept. Database services should return what was asked for, and nothing else. → Use [*Localized Queries*](#localized-queries) if you really want to read localized data from the database:

```js
SELECT.localized(Books)  // reads localized data
SELECT.from(Books)       // reads plain data
```

::: details No changes to app services behaviour

Generic application service handlers use *SELECT.localized* to request localized data from the database. Hence, CAP services automatically serve localized data as before.

:::





<!-- ### New Streaming API {.impl .node}

TODO: New STREAM event, ...

-->

### Skipped BLOBs {.impl .node}

Formerly, `LargeBinary` elements, a.k.a. BLOBs, always got served as any other column. Now, they are skipped from _SELECT *_ queries. Yet, you can still enforce reading them by explicitly selecting them.

For example:

```js
SELECT.from(Books)          //> [{ ID, title, ..., image }] // [!code --]
SELECT.from(Books)          //> [{ ID, title, ... }]
SELECT('image').from(Books) //> [{ image }]
```

::: tip Avoid direct reads of BLOBs

Even if we still support direct reads, as shown in the third line above, you should generally refrain from using that option. One reason is that BLOBs hold potentially large amounts of data, so they should be streamed. Another reason is that some databases don't support that. If you really need to do such a thing, consider using non-large `Binary` elements instead.

:::



### Skipped Virtuals {.impl .node}

In contrast to their former behaviour, new database services ignore all virtual elements and hence don't add them to result set entries. Selecting only virtual elements in a query leads to an error.

::: details Reasoning

Virtual elements are meant to be calculated and filled in by custom handlers of your application services. Nevertheless, the old database services always returned `null`, or specified `default` values for virtual elements. This behavior was removed, as it provides very little value, if at all.

:::

For example, given this definition:

```cds
entity Foo {
  foo : Integer;
  virtual bar : Integer;
}
```

The behaviour has changed to:

```js
SELECT.from('Foo')         //> [{ foo:1, bar:null }, ...] // [!code --]
SELECT.from('Foo')         //> [{ foo:1 }, ...]
SELECT('bar').from('Foo')  //> ERROR: no columns to read
```

### <> Operator {.impl .node}

Before, both `<>` and `!=` were translated to `name <> 'John' OR name is null`.
* The operator `<>` now works as specified in the SQL standard.
* `name != 'John'` is translated as before to `name <> 'John' OR name is null`.


::: warning
This is a breaking change in regard to the previous implementation.
:::

### Miscellaneous {.impl .node}

- Only `$now` and `$user` are supported as values for `@cds.on.insert/update`.
- CQNs with subqueries require table aliases to refer to elements of outer queries.
- Table aliases must not contain dots.
- CQNs with an empty columns array now throw an error.
- `*` isn't a column reference. Use `columns: ['*']` instead of `columns: [{ref:'*'}]`.
- Column names in CSVs must map to physical column names:

```csvc
ID;title;author_ID;currency_code // [!code ++]
ID;title;author.ID;currency.code // [!code --]
```



### Adopt Lean Draft  {.impl .node}

As mentioned in [Using Lean Draft](#using-lean-draft), we eliminated all draft handling from new database service implementations, and instead implemented draft in a modular, non-intrusive, and optimized way — called *'Lean Draft'*.

When using the new service, the new `cds.fiori.lean_draft` mode is automatically switched on. You may additionally switch on `cds.fiori.draft_compat` in case you run into problems.

More detailed documentation for that is coming.





### Finalizing Migration  {.impl .node}

When you have finished migration, remove the old [*sqlite3* driver](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sqlite3) :

```sh
npm rm sqlite3
```

And activate the new one as cds-plugin:

```sh
npm add @cap-js/sqlite --save
```

</div>

## SQLite in Production?

As stated in the beginning, SQLite is mostly intended to speed up development, but is not fit for production. This is not because of limited warranties or lack of support, but rather because of suitability.

A major criterion is this: cloud applications are usually served by server clusters, in which each server is connected to a shared database. SQLite could only be used in such setups with the persistent database file accessed through a network file system. This is rarely available and results in slow performance. Hence, an enterprise client-server database is a more fitting choice for these scenarios.

Having said this, there can indeed be scenarios where SQLite might also be used in production, such as using SQLite as in-memory caches. → [Find a detailed list of criteria on the sqlite.org website](https://www.sqlite.org/whentouse.html).

::: warning
SQLite only has limited support for concurrent database access due to its very coarse lock granularity. This makes it badly suited for applications with high concurrency.
:::
