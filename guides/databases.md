## Setup & Configuration

<div markdown="1" class="impl node">

### Adding Database Packages  {.impl .node}

Following are cds-plugin packages for CAP Node.js runtime that support respective databases:

| Database                       | Package                                                      | Remarks                            |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| **[SAP HANA Cloud](databases-hana)**     | [`@sap/cds-hana`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sap/cds-hana) | recommended for production         |
| **[SQLite](databases-sqlite)**       | [`@cap-js/sqlite`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cap-js/sqlite) | recommended for development        |
| **[PostgreSQL](databases-postgres)** | [`@cap-js/postgres`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cap-js/postgres) | maintained by community + CAP team |

<!-- Do we really need to say that? -->
> Follow the links above to find specific information for each.

In general, all you need to do is to install one of the database packages, as follows:

Using SQLite for development:

```sh
npm add @cap-js/sqlite -D
```

Using SAP HANA for production:

```sh
npm add @sap/cds-hana
```

<!-- REVISIT: A bit confusing to prefer the non-copiable variant that doesn't get its own code fence -->
::: details Prefer `cds add hana` ...

... which also does the equivalent of `npm add @sap/cds-hana` but in addition cares for updating `mta.yaml` and other deployment resources as documented in the [deployment guide](deployment/to-cf#_1-using-sap-hana-database).

:::

### Auto-Wired Configuration  {.impl .node}

The afore-mentioned packages use `cds-plugin` techniques to automatically configure the primary database with `cds.env`. For example, if you added SQLite and SAP HANA, this effectively results in this auto-wired configuration:

<!-- REVISIT: hdbtable is now default, should we mention it anyway? -->
```json
{"cds":{
  "requires": {
    "db": {
      "[development]": { "kind": "sqlite", "impl": "@cap-js/sqlite", "credentials": { "url": "memory" } },
      "[production]": { "kind": "hana", "impl": "@sap/cds-hana", "deploy-format": "hdbtable" }
    }
  }
}}
```

::: details In contrast to pre CDS 7 setups this means...

1. You don't need to — and should not — add direct dependencies to driver packages, like [`hdb`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hdb) or [`sqlite3`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sqlite3) anymore in your *package.json* files.
2. You don't need to configure `cds.requires.db` anymore, unless you want to override defaults brought with the new packages.

:::



### Custom Configuration  {.impl .node}

The previous setups auto-wire things through configuration presets, which are automatically enabled via `cds-plugin` techniques. You can always use the basic configurations for other setups, or override individual properties as follows:

1. Install a database driver package, e.g.
   ```sh
   npm add @cap-js/sqlite
   ```

   > Add option `-D` if you want this for development only.

2. Configure the primary database as a required service through `cds.requires.db`, for example:

   ```json
   {"cds":{
     "requires": {
       "db": {
         "kind": "sqlite",
         "impl": "@cap-js/sqlite",
         "credentials": {
           "url": "db.sqlite"
         }
       }
     }
   }}
   ```

The config options are as follows:

- `kind` — a name of a preset, like `sql`, `sqlite`, `postgres`, or `hana`
- `impl` — the module name of a CAP database service implementation
- `credentials` — an object with db-specific configurations, most commonly `url`

::: warning Don't configure credentials

Credentials like `username` and  `password` should **not** be added here but provided through service bindings, for example, via `cds bind`.

:::

::: tip Use `cds env` to inspect effective configuration

For example, running this command:

```sh
cds env cds.requires.db
```
→ prints:

```sh
{
  kind: 'sqlite',
  impl: '@cap-js/sqlite',
  credentials: { url: 'db.sqlite' }
}
```

<div markdown="1" class="impl java">

CAP Java has built-in support for different SQL-based databases via JDBC. This section describes the different databases and any differences between them with respect to CAP features. There's out of the box support for SAP HANA with CAP currently as well as H2 and SQLite. However, it's important to note that H2 and SQLite aren't an enterprise grade database and are recommended for non-productive use like local development or CI tests only. PostgreSQL is supported in addition, but has various limitations in comparison to SAP HANA, most notably in the area of schema evolution.

Database support is enabled by adding a Maven dependency to the JDBC driver, as shown in the following table:

| Database                       | JDBC Driver                                                 | Remarks                            |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| **[SAP HANA Cloud](databases-hana)**     | `com.sap.cloud.db.jdbc:ngdbc` | Recommended for productive use         |
| **[H2](databases-h2)**       | `com.h2database:h2` | Recommended for development and CI     |
| **[SQLite](databases-sqlite)**       | `org.xerial:sqlite-jdbc` | Supported for development and CI <br> Recommended for local MTX |
| **[PostgreSQL](databases-postgres)** | `org.postgresql:postgresql` | Supported for productive use |

[Learn more about supported databases in CAP Java and their configuration](../java/persistence-services#database-support){ .learn-more}
</div>

## Providing Initial Data

Put CSV files into `db/data` to fill your database with initial data.

<div markdown="1" class="impl node">

For example, in our [*cap/samples/bookshop*](https://github.com/SAP-samples/cloud-cap-samples/tree/main/bookshop/db/data) application, we do so for *Books*, *Authors*, and *Genres* as follows:

```zsh
bookshop/
├─ db/
│ └─ data/ #> place your .csv files here
│ │ ├─ sap.capire.bookshop-Authors.csv
│ │ ├─ sap.capire.bookshop-Books.csv
│ │ ├─ sap.capire.bookshop-Books.texts.csv
│ │ └─ sap.capire.bookshop-Genres.csv
│ └─ schema.cds
└─ ...
```
</div>

<div markdown="1" class="impl java">

For example, in our [CAP Samples for Java](https://github.com/SAP-samples/cloud-cap-samples-java/tree/main/db/data) application, we do so for some entities such as *Books*, *Authors*, and *Genres* as follows:

```zsh
db/
└─ data/ #> place your .csv files here
│ ├─ my.bookshop-Authors.csv
│ ├─ my.bookshop-Books.csv
│ ├─ my.bookshop-Books.texts.csv
│ └─ my.bookshop-Genres.csv
| └─ ...
└─ index.cds
```
</div>


The **filenames** are expected to match fully qualified names of respective entity definitions in your CDS models, optionally using a dash `-` instead of a dot `.` for cosmetic reasons.

### Using `.csv` Files

The **content** of these files is standard CSV content with the column titles corresponding to declared element names, like for `Books`:

::: code-group

```csvc [db/data/sap.capire.bookshop-Books.csv]
ID,title,author_ID,stock
201,Wuthering Heights,101,12
207,Jane Eyre,107,11
251,The Raven,150,333
252,Eleonora,150,555
271,Catweazle,170,22
```

:::

> Note: `author_ID` is the generated foreign key for the managed Association  `author` → learn more about that in the [Generating SQL DDL](#generating-sql-ddl) section.

If your content contains ...

- commas or line breaks → enclose it in double quotes `"..."`
- double quotes → escape them with doubled double quotes: `""...""`

```csvc
ID,title,descr
252,Eleonora,"""Eleonora"" is a short story by Edgar Allan Poe, first published in 1842 in Philadelphia in the literary annual The Gift."
```

::: danger
On SAP HANA, only use CSV files for _configuration data_ that can't be changed by application users.
→ See [CSV data gets overridden in the SAP HANA guide for details](databases-hana#csv-data-gets-overridden).
:::

### Use `cds add data`

Run this to generate an initial set of empty `.csv` files with header lines based on your CDS model:

```sh
cds add data
```

### Location of CSV Files

Quite frequently you need to distinguish between sample data and real initial data. CAP supports this by allowing you to provide initial data in two places:

<div markdown="1" class="impl node">

| Location    | Deployed...          | Purpose                                                  |
| ----------- | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `db/data`   | always               | initial data for configurations, code lists, and similar |
| `test/data` | if not in production | sample data for tests and demos                          |

</div>

<div markdown="1" class="impl java">

Use the properties [cds.dataSource.csv.*](../java/development/properties#cds-dataSource-csv) to configure the location of the CSV files. You can configure different sets of CSV files in different [Spring profiles](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#features.profiles). This configuration reads CSV data from `test/data` if the profile `test` is active:

::: code-group

```yaml [srv/src/main/resources/application.yaml]
---
spring:
  config.activate.on-profile: test
cds
  dataSource.csv.paths:
  - test/data/**
```

:::
</div>





## Querying at Runtime




Most queries to databases are constructed and executed from [generic event handlers of CRUD requests](providing-services#serving-crud), so quite frequently there's nothing to do. The following is for the remaining cases where you have to provide custom logic, and as part of it execute database queries.




### DB-Agnostic Queries

<div markdown="1" class="impl node">

At runtime, we usually [construct and execute queries using cds.ql](querying) APIs in a database-agnostic way. For example, queries like this are supported for all databases:

```js
SELECT.from (Authors, a => {
  a.ID, a.name, a.books (b => {
    b.ID, b.title
  })
})
.where ({name:{like:'A%'}})
.orderBy ('name')
```

</div>

<div markdown="1" class="impl java">

At runtime, we usually construct queries using the [CQL Query Builder API](../java/query-api) in a database-agnostic way. For example, queries like this are supported for all databases:

```java
Select.from(AUTHOR)
      .columns(a -> a.id(), a -> a.name(),
               a -> a.books().expand(b -> b.id(), b.title()))
      .where(a -> a.name().startWith("A"))
      .orderBy(a -> a.name());
```

</div>



### Native DB Queries

If required you can also use native database features by executing native SQL queries:

<div markdown="1" class="impl node">

```js
cds.db.run (`SELECT from sqlite_schema where name like ?`, name)
```
</div>

<div markdown="1" class="impl java">

Use Spring's [JDBC Template](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jdbc/core/JdbcTemplate.html) to [leverage native database features](../java/advanced#jdbctemplate) as follows:

```java
@Autowired
JdbcTemplate db;
...
db.queryForList("SELECT from sqlite_schema where name like ?", name);
```
</div>

## Generating DDL Files {#generating-sql-ddl}

<div markdown="1" class="impl node">


When you run your server with `cds watch` during development, an in-memory database is bootstrapped automatically, with SQL DDL statements generated based on your CDS models.

</div>

<div markdown="1" class="impl java">

When you've created a CAP Java application with `cds init --add java` or with CAP Java's [Maven archetype](../java/development/#the-maven-archetype), the Maven build invokes the CDS compiler to generate a `schema.sql` file for your target database. In the `default` profile (development mode), an in-memory database is [initialized by Spring](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#howto.data-initialization) and the schema is bootstrapped from the `schema.sql` file.

</div>

You can also do this manually with the CLI command `cds compile --to <dialect>`.

### Using `cds compile -2 <dialect>`

For example, given these CDS models (derived from [*cap/samples/bookshop*](https://github.com/SAP-samples/cloud-cap-samples/tree/main/bookshop)):

::: code-group

```cds [db/schema.cds]
using { Currency } from '@sap/cds/common';
namespace sap.capire.bookshop;

entity Books {
  key ID : UUID;
  title  : localized String;
  descr  : localized String;
  author : Association to Authors;
  price  : {
    amount   : Decimal;
    currency : Currency;
  }
}

entity Authors {
  key ID : UUID;
  name  : String;
  books : Association to many Books on books.author = $self;
}
```
:::
::: code-group

```cds [srv/cat-service.cds]
using { sap.capire.bookshop as my } from '../db/schema';
service CatalogService {
  entity ListOfBooks as projection on Books {
    *, author.name as author
  }
}
```
:::


Generate an SQL DDL script by running this in the root directory containing both *.cds* files:

```sh
cds compile srv/cat-service --to sqlite > schema.sql
```

Output:

::: code-group

```sql [schema.sql]
CREATE TABLE sap_capire_bookshop_Books (
  ID NVARCHAR(36) NOT NULL,
  title NVARCHAR(5000),
  descr NVARCHAR(5000),
  author_ID NVARCHAR(36),
  price_amount DECIMAL,
  price_currency_code NVARCHAR(3),
  PRIMARY KEY(ID)
);

CREATE TABLE sap_capire_bookshop_Authors (
  ID NVARCHAR(36) NOT NULL,
  name NVARCHAR(5000),
  PRIMARY KEY(ID)
);

CREATE TABLE sap_common_Currencies (
  name NVARCHAR(255),
  descr NVARCHAR(1000),
  code NVARCHAR(3) NOT NULL,
  symbol NVARCHAR(5),
  minorUnit SMALLINT,
  PRIMARY KEY(code)
);

CREATE TABLE sap_capire_bookshop_Books_texts (
  locale NVARCHAR(14) NOT NULL,
  ID NVARCHAR(36) NOT NULL,
  title NVARCHAR(5000),
  descr NVARCHAR(5000),
  PRIMARY KEY(locale, ID)
);

CREATE VIEW CatalogService_ListOfBooks AS SELECT
  Books.ID,
  Books.title,
  Books.descr,
  author.name AS author,
  Books.price_amount,
  Books.price_currency_code
FROM sap_capire_bookshop_Books AS Books
LEFT JOIN sap_capire_bookshop_Authors AS author
ON Books.author_ID = author.ID;

--- some more technical views skipped ...
```

:::

::: tip
Use the specific SQL dialect (`hana`, `sqlite`, `h2`, `postgres`) with `cds compile --to <dialect>` to get DDL that matches the target database.
:::


### Rules for Generated DDL

A few observations on the generated SQL DDL output:

1. **Tables / Views** — Declared entities become tables, projected entities become views.
2. **Type Mapping** — [CDS types are mapped to database-specific SQL types](../cds/types).
3. **Slugified FQNs** — Dots in fully qualified CDS names become underscores in SQL names.
4. **Flattened Structs** — Structured elements like `Books:price` are flattened with underscores.
5. **Generated Foreign Keys** — For managed to-one Associations, foreign key columns are created. For example, this applies to `Books:author`.





In addition, you can use the following annotations to fine-tune generated SQL.



### @cds.persistence.skip

Add `@cds.persistence.skip` to an entity to indicate that this entity should be skipped from generated DDL scripts, and also no SQL views to be generated on top of it:

```cds
@cds.persistence.skip
entity Foo {...}                 //> No SQL table will be generated
entity Bar as select from Foo;   //> No SQL view will be generated
```



### @cds.persistence.exists

Add `@cds.persistence.exists` to an entity to indicate that this entity should be skipped from generated DDL scripts. In contrast to `@cds.persistence.skip` a database relation is expected to exist, so we can generate SQL views on top.

```cds
@cds.persistence.exists
entity Foo {...}                 //> No SQL table will be generated
entity Bar as select from Foo;   //> The SQL view will be generated
```

::: details On SAP HANA ...

If the respective entity is a user-defined function or a calculation view, one of the annotations `@cds.persistence.udf` or `@cds.persistence.calcview` also needs to be assigned. See [Calculated Views and User-Defined Functions](../advanced/hana#calculated-views-and-user-defined-functions) for more details.

:::



### @cds.persistence.table

Annotate an entity with `@cds.persistence.table` to create a table with the effective signature of the view definition instead of an SQL view.

```cds
@cds.persistence.table
entity Foo as projection on Bar {...}
```

> All parts of the view definition not relevant for the signature (like `where`, `group by`, ...) are ignored.

Use case for this annotation: Use projections on imported APIs as replica cache tables.



### @sql.prepend / append

Use `@sql.prepend` and `@sql.append` to add native SQL clauses to before or after generated SQL output of CDS entities or elements.

Example:

````cds
@sql.append: ```sql
  GROUP TYPE foo
  GROUP SUBTYPE bar
```
entity E { ...,
  @sql.append: 'FUZZY SEARCH INDEX ON'
  text: String(100);
}

@sql.append: 'WITH DDL ONLY'
entity V as select from E { ... };
````

Output:

```sql
CREATE TABLE E ( ...,
  text NVARCHAR(100) FUZZY SEARCH INDEX ON
) GROUP TYPE foo
GROUP SUBTYPE bar;

CREATE VIEW V AS SELECT ... FROM E WITH DDL ONLY;
```

The following rules apply:

- The compiler doesn't check or process the provided SQL snippets in any way. You're responsible to ensure that the resulting statement is valid and doesn't negatively impact your database or your application. We don't provide support for problems caused by using this feature.

- If you refer to a column name in the annotation, you need to take care of
  a potential name mapping yourself, for example, for structured elements.

- Annotation `@sql.prepend` is only supported for entities translating to tables. It can't be used with views nor with elements.
- For SAP HANA tables, there's an implicit  that is overwritten by an explicitly provided `@sql.prepend`.

* Both `@sql.prepend` and `@sql.append` are disallowed in SaaS extension projects.

If you use native database clauses in combination with `@cds.persistence.journal`, see [Schema Evolution Support of Native Database Clauses](databases-hana#schema-evolution-native-db-clauses).





### Reserved Words

The CDS compiler and CAP runtimes provide smart quoting for reserved words in SQLite and in SAP HANA so that they can still be used in most situations. But in general reserved words cannot be used as identifiers. The list of reserved words varies per database.

Find here a collection of resources on selected databases and their reference documentation:

* [SAP HANA SQL Reference Guide for SAP HANA Platform (Cloud Version)](https://help.sap.com/docs/HANA_SERVICE_CF/7c78579ce9b14a669c1f3295b0d8ca16/28bcd6af3eb6437892719f7c27a8a285.html)
* [SAP HANA SQL Reference Guide for SAP HANA Cloud](https://help.sap.com/docs/HANA_CLOUD_DATABASE/c1d3f60099654ecfb3fe36ac93c121bb/28bcd6af3eb6437892719f7c27a8a285.html)
* [SQLite Keywords](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_keywords.html)
* [H2 Keywords/Reserved Words](https://www.h2database.com/html/advanced.html#keywords)

[There are also reserved words related to SAP Fiori.](../advanced/fiori#reserved-words){.learn-more}





## Database Constraints {#db-constraints}

The information about foreign key relations contained in the associations of CDS models can be used to generate foreign key constraints on the database tables. Within CAP, referential consistency is established only at commit. The ["deferred" concept for foreign key constraints](https://www.sqlite.org/foreignkeys.html) in SQL databases allows the constraints to be checked and enforced at the time of the [COMMIT statement within a transaction](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_transaction.html) rather than immediately when the data is modified, providing more flexibility in maintaining data integrity.

Enable generation of foreign key constraints on the database with:

```js
cds.features.assert_integrity = 'db'
```

::: warning Database constraints are not supported for H2
Referential constraints on H2 cannot be defined as "deferred", which is needed for database constraints within CAP.
:::

With that switched on, foreign key constraints are generated for managed to-one associations. For example, given this model:

```cds
entity Books {
  key ID : Integer; ...
  author : Association to Authors;
}
entity Authors {
  key ID : Integer; ...
}
```

The following `Books_author` constraint would be added to table `Books`:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Authors (
  ID INTEGER NOT NULL,  -- primary key referenced by the constraint
  ...,
  PRIMARY KEY(ID)
);
CREATE TABLE Books (
  ID INTEGER NOT NULL,
  author_ID INTEGER,    -- generated foreign key field
  ...,
  PRIMARY KEY(ID),
  CONSTRAINT Books_author //[!code focus]
    FOREIGN KEY(author_ID)  -- link generated foreign key field author_ID ...
    REFERENCES Authors(ID)  -- ... with primary key field ID of table Authors
    ON UPDATE RESTRICT
    ON DELETE RESTRICT
    VALIDATED           -- validate existing entries when constraint is created
    ENFORCED            -- validate changes by insert/update/delete
    INITIALLY DEFERRED  -- validate only at commit
)
```

No constraints are generated for...
* Unmanaged associations or compositions
* To-many associations or compositions
* Associations annotated with `@assert.integrity: false`
* Associations where the source or target entity is annotated with `@cds.persistence.exists` or `@cds.persistence.skip`

If the association is the backlink of a **composition**, the constraint's delete rule changes to `CASCADE`.
That applies, for example, to the `parent` association in here:

```cds
entity Genres {
  key ID   : Integer;
  parent   : Association to Genres;
  children : Composition of many Genres on children.parent = $self;
}
```

As a special case, a referential constraint with `delete cascade` is also generated
for the text table of a [localized entity](../guides/localized-data#localized-data),
although no managed association is present in the `texts` entity.

Add a localized element to entity `Books` from the previous example:
```cds
entity Books {
  key ID : Integer; ...
  title : localized String;
}
```

The generated text table then is:
```sql
CREATE TABLE Books_texts (
  locale NVARCHAR(14) NOT NULL,
  ID INTEGER NOT NULL,
  title NVARCHAR(5000),
  PRIMARY KEY(locale, ID),
  CONSTRAINT Books_texts_texts //[!code focus]
    FOREIGN KEY(ID)
    REFERENCES Books(ID)
    ON UPDATE RESTRICT
    ON DELETE CASCADE
    VALIDATED
    ENFORCED
    INITIALLY DEFERRED
)
```

::: warning Database constraints aren't intended for checking user input
Instead, they protect the integrity of your data in the database layer against programming errors. If a constraint violation occurs, the error messages coming from the database aren't standardized by the runtimes but presented as-is.

→ Use [`@assert.target`](providing-services#assert-target) for corresponding input validations.
:::



## Using Native Features  { #native-db-functions}

In general, the CDS 2 SQL compiler doesn't 'understand' SQL functions but translates them to SQL generically as long as they follow the standard call syntax of `function(param1, param2)`. This allows you to use native database functions inside your CDS models.

Example:

```cds
entity BookPreview as select from Books {
  IFNULL (descr, title) as shorttext   //> using HANA function IFNULL
};
```

The `OVER` clause for SQL Window Functions is supported, too:

```cds
entity RankedBooks as select from Books {
  name, author,
  rank() over (partition by author order by price) as rank
};
```



#### Using Native Functions with Different DBs { #sqlite-and-hana-functions}

In case of conflicts, follow these steps to provide different models for different databases:

1. Add database-specific schema extensions in specific subfolders of `./db`:

   ::: code-group

   ```cds [db/sqlite/index.cds]
   using { AdminService } from '..';
   extend projection AdminService.Authors with {
      strftime('%Y',dateOfDeath)-strftime('%Y',dateOfBirth) as age : Integer
   }
   ```

   ```cds [db/hana/index.cds]
   using { AdminService } from '..';
   extend projection AdminService.Authors with {
      YEARS_BETWEEN(dateOfBirth, dateOfDeath) as age : Integer
   }
   ```

   :::

2. Add configuration in specific profiles to your *package.json*, to use these database-specific extensions:

   ```json
   { "cds": { "requires": {
     "db": {
      "kind": "sql",
      "[development]": { "model": "db/sqlite" },
      "[production]": { "model": "db/hana" }
    }
   }}}
   ```

CAP samples demonstrate this in [cap/samples/fiori](https://github.com/SAP-samples/cloud-cap-samples/commit/65c8c82f745e0097fab6ca8164a2ede8400da803). <br>
There's also a [code tour](https://github.com/SAP-samples/cloud-cap-samples#code-tours) available for that.
