# Health Checks

On both Cloud Foundry and Kubernetes, it is possible to provide two separate endpoints for liveness checks ("are you alive?") and readiness checks ("are you ready for more requests?").
A failure on the former leads to a restart, whereas a failure on the latter temporarily takes the app instance out of the request dispatching rotation until a subsequent readiness probe is successful.

::: warning Limited support for readiness checks on CF
Although supported by the Cloud Foundry core, readiness checks are not yet supported by the Cloud Foundtry CLI as well as the Cloud MTA Build Tool (MBT).
:::

The Node.js runtime provides an out-of-the-box endpoint for liveness and readiness checks at `/health`.
Requests that reach this public endpoint are answered with the status code 200 and the body `{ status: 'UP' }`.

For CAP Java, the `cds add` facets `mta`, `cf-manifest`, `helm`, and `helm-unified-runtime` add the necessary dependencies and configuration for the publicly available probe endpoints `/actuator/health/liveness` and `/actuator/health/readiness`.
For more details on adding Spring Boot health checks to your CAP Java app, please see [Spring Boot Health Checks](../../java/operating-applications/observability#spring-health-checks).

<!--

To achieve this, from `@sap/cds-dk^7.8` onwards, the configuration for readiness health checks is included in the MTA template for deployment to CF.
The default configuration specifies checks via http to `/` for Java (as there aren't any default Spring Boot health check endpoints) and `/health` for Node.js, respectively.

Additionally, for Node.js, the Helm chart template now specifies `/health` instead of `/` as the endpoint for the checks. For your app to be considered "alive", the endpoint `/health` needs to return a success response code.
This means, if you have a _fully custom_ `server.js`, you will need to add the `/health` endpoint to it, or adjust your MTA descriptor/Helm chart (if it's generated with `@sap/cds-dk^7.8`).

-->

For deployment to Kyma/ Kubernetes, `@sap/cds-dk` adds the necessary configurations to Helm charts to make the setup complete.
Once supported, `@sap/cds-dk` will also add the necessary configurations to MTA deployment descriptors.

::: tip
Don't forget to adjust the values in your deployment descriptors in case you add different Spring Boot health check endpoints or use a _fully custom_ `server.js`.
