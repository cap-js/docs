# Extensibility

{{ $frontmatter.synopsis }}

Extensibility of CAP applications is greatly fueled by **CDS Aspects**, which allow to easily extend existing models with new fields, entities, relationships, or new or overridden annotations [&rarr; Learn more about using CDS Aspects in the Domain Modeling guide](../domain-modeling#separation-of-concerns).

![This screenshot is explained in the accompanying text.](assets/extensibility.drawio.svg)

As illustrated in the graphic above, different parties can build and deploy CDS Aspects-based extensions:

- **Customizations** – Customers/Subscribers of SaaS solutions need options to tailor these to their needs, again using CDS Aspects to add custom fields and entities.

- **Toggled Features** – SaaS providers can offer pre-built enhancement features, which can be switched on selectively per tenant using Feature Toggles, for example, specialization for selected industries.

- **Composition** – Finally, 3rd parties can provide pre-built extension packages for reuse, which customers can pick and compose into own solutions.

- **Verticalization** – 3rd parties can provide verticalized versions of a given base application, which they can in turn operate as verticalized SaaS apps.
