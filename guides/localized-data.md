# Localized Data

{{ $frontmatter.synopsis }}

Localized data refers to the maintenance of different translations of textual data and automatically fetching the translations matching the users' preferred language, with per-row fallback to default languages, if the required translations aren't available. Language codes are in ISO 639-1 format.

## Declaring Localized Data

Use the `localized` modifier to mark entity elements that require translated texts.

```cds
entity Books {
  key ID       : UUID;
      title    : localized String;
      descr    : localized String;
      price    : Decimal;
      currency : Currency;
}
```

::: warning _Restriction_
If you want to use the `localized` modifier, the entity's keys must not be associations.
:::

> `localized` in entity sub elements isn't currently supported and is ignored.
> This includes `localized` in structured elements and structured types.

## Behind the Scenes

The `cds` compiler automatically unfolds the previous definition as follows,
applying the basic mechanisms of [Managed Compositions](../cds/cdl#managed-compositions),
and [Scoped Names](../cds/cdl#scoped-names):

First, a separate _Books.texts_ entity is added to hold translated texts:

```cds
entity Books.texts {
  key locale : sap.common.Locale;
  key ID : UUID; //= source's primary key
  title : String;
  descr : String;
}
```

[See the definition of `sap.common.Locale`.](../cds/common#locale-type){ .learn-more}
::: warning Note:
The above shows the situation with CDS compiler v2. Former versions of the
compiler generated an entity `Books_texts`.
:::

Second, the source entity is extended with associations to _Books.texts_:

```cds
extend entity Books with {
  texts : Composition of many Books.texts on texts.ID=ID;
  localized : Association to Books.texts on localized.ID=ID
    and localized.locale = $user.locale;
}
```

The composition `texts` points to all translated texts for the given entity, whereas the `localized` association points to the translated texts and is narrowed to the request's locale.

Third, views are generated in SQL DDL to easily read localized texts with an equivalent fallback:

```cds
entity localized.Books as select from Books {*,
  coalesce (localized.title, title) as title,
  coalesce (localized.descr, descr) as descr
};
```
::: warning Note:
In contrast to former versions, with CDS compiler v2 we don't add such entities to CSN anymore, but only on generated SQL DDL output.
:::

### Resolving localized texts via views

As we already mentioned, the CDS compiler is already creating views that resolve the translated texts internally. Once a CDS runtime detects
a request with a user locale, it uses those views instead of the table of the involved entity.

Note that SQLite doesn't support locales like _SAP HANA_ does. For _SQLite_, additional views are generated for different languages. Currently those views are generated for the locales 'de' and 'fr' and the default locale is handled as 'en'.

```json
"i18n": { "for_sqlite": ["en", ...] }
```

> In _package.json_ put this snippet in the `cds` block, but don't do so for _.cdsrc.json_.

> For testing with SQLite: Make sure that the _Books_ table contains the English texts and that the other languages go into the _Books.texts_ table.

For _H2_, you need to use the property as follows.

```json
"i18n": { "for_sql": ["en", ...] }
```


### Resolving search over localized texts at runtime { #resolving-localized-texts-at-runtime}

Although the approach with the generated localized views is very convenient, it's limited on SQLite and shows suboptimal performance with large data sets on _SAP HANA_. Especially for search operations the performance penalty is very critical. Therefore, both CAP runtimes have implemented a solution targeted for search operations. If the `localized` association of your entity is present and accessible by the given CQL statement, the runtimes generate SQL statements that resolve the localized texts. This is optimized for the underlying database.

When your CQL queries select entities directly there is no issue as the `localized` association is automatically accessible in an entity with localized elements. If your CQL query selects from a view, it is important that your views' projection preserves the `localized` association.

The following view definitions preserve the `localized` association in the view, allowing you to optimize query execution, or for broader language support on SQLite, H2, and PostgreSQL.

**Preferred -** Exclude elements that mustn't be exposed:

```cds
entity OpenBookView as select from Books {*}
  excluding {price, currency};
```

Include the `localized` association:

```cds
entity ClosedBookView as select from Books {ID, title, descr, localized};
```


### Base Entities Stay Intact

In contrast to similar strategies, all texts aren't externalized but the original texts are kept in the source entity. This saves one join when reading localized texts with fallback to the original ones.


### Extending *.texts* Entities { #extending-texts-entities}

It's possible to collectively extend all generated *.texts* entities by extending
the aspect `sap.common.TextsAspect`, which is defined in [*common.cds*](../cds/common#texts-aspects).

For example, the aspect can be used to add an association to the `Languages` code list entity,
or to add flags that help you to control the translation process.

Example:
```cds
extend sap.common.TextsAspect with {
  language : Association to sap.common.Languages on language.code = locale;
}
```

The earlier description is simplified, *.texts* entities are generated with an include on `sap.common.TextsAspect`,
if the aspect exists. For the *Books* entity, the generated *.texts*
entity looks like:

```cds
entity Books.texts : sap.common.TextsAspect {
  key ID : UUID;
  title : String;
  descr : String;
}
```

When the include is expanded, the key element `locale` is inserted into *.texts* entities,
alongside all the other elements that have been added to `sap.common.TextsAspect` via extensions.

```cds
entity Books.texts {
  // from sap.common.TextsAspect
  key locale: sap.common.Locale;
  language : Association to sap.common.Languages on language.code = locale;
  // from Books
  key ID : UUID;
  title : String;
  descr : String;
}
```

It isn't allowed to extend `sap.common.TextsAspect` with
* [Managed Compositions of Aspects](../cds/cdl#managed-compositions)
* localized elements
* key elements

For entities that have an annotation `@fiori.draft.enabled`, the corresponding *.texts*
entities also include the aspect, but the element `locale` isn't marked as a
key and an element `key ID_texts : UUID` is added.

## Pseudo var `$user.locale` { #user-locale}

[`$user.locale`]: #user-locale

As shown in the second step, the pseudo variable `$user.locale` is used to refer to the user's preferred locale and join matching translations from `.texts` tables. This pseudo variable allows expressing such queries in a database-independent way, which is realized in the service runtimes as follows:

### Determining `$user.locale` from Inbound Requests

The user's preferred locale is determined from request parameters, user settings, or the _accept-language_ header of inbound requests [as explained in the Localization guide](i18n#user-locale).

### Programmatic Access to `$user.locale`

The resulting [normalized locale](i18n#normalized-locales) is available programmatically, in your event handlers.

* Node.js: `req.locale`
* Java: `eventContext.getParameterInfo().getLocale()`

### Propagating `$user.locale` to Databases {#propagating-of-user-locale}
[propagation]: #propagating-of-user-locale

Finally, the [normalized locale](i18n#normalized-locales) is **propagated** to underlying databases using session variables, that is, `$user.locale` translates to `session_context('locale')` in native SQL of SAP HANA and most databases.

Not all databases support session variables. For example, for _SQLite_ we currently would just create stand-in views for selected languages. With that, the APIs are kept stable but have restricted feature support.

## Reading Localized Data

Given the asserted unfolding and user locales propagated to the database, you can read localized data as follows:

### In Agnostic Code

Read _original_ texts, that is, the ones in the originally created data entry:

```sql
SELECT ID, title, descr from Books
```

### For End Users

Reading texts for end users uses the `localized` association, which requires prior [propagation] of [`$user.locale`] to the underlying database.

Read _localized_ texts in the user's preferred language:

```sql
SELECT ID, localized.title, localized.descr from Books
```

<!-- This is currently not supported by the compiler:
Read **_localized_ texts _with fallback_** to the texts in originally inserted language:
```sql
SELECT ID, title, descr from localized.Books
```
-->

### For Translation UIs

Translation UIs read and write texts in all languages, independent from the current user's preferred one. They use the to-many `texts` association, which is independent from [`$user.locale`].

Read texts in **different** translations:

```sql
SELECT ID, texts[locale='fr'].title, texts[locale='fr'].descr from Books
```

Read texts in **all** translations:

```sql
SELECT ID, texts.locale, texts.title, texts.descr from Books
```

## Serving Localized Data

The generic handlers of the service runtimes automatically serve read requests from `localized` views. Users see all texts in their preferred language or the fallback language.

[See also **Enabling Draft for Localized Data**.](../advanced/fiori#draft-for-localized-data){ .learn-more}

For example, given this service definition:

```cds
using { Books } from './books';
service CatalogService {
  entity BooksList as projection on Books { ID, title, price };
  entity BooksDetails as projection on Books;
}
```

### `localized.` Helper Views

For each exposed entity in a service definition, and all intermediate views, a corresponding `localized.` entity is created. It has the same query clauses and all annotations, except for the `from` clause being redirected to the underlying entity's `localized.` counterpart.

```cds
using { localized.Books } from './books_localized';

entity localized.CatalogService.BooksList as
SELECT from localized.Books { ID, title, price };

entity localized.CatalogService.BooksDetails as
SELECT from localized.Books;
```
::: warning Note:
In contrast to former versions, with CDS compiler v2 we don't add such entities to CSN anymore but only on generated SQL DDL output. Note that these `localized.` entities also aren't exposed through OData.
:::

### Read Operations

The generic handlers in the service framework will automatically redirect all incoming read requests to the `localized_` helper views in the SQL database, unless in SAP Fiori draft mode.

The `@cds.localized: false` annotation can be used to explicitly switch off the automatic redirection to the localized views. All incoming requests to an entity annotated with `@cds.localized: false` will directly access the base entity.

```cds
using { Books } from './books';
service CatalogService {
  @cds.localized: false //> direct access to base entity; all fields are non-localized defaults
  entity BooksDetails as projection on Books;
}
```
In Node.js applications, for requests with an `$expand` query option on entities annotated with `@cds.localized: false`, the expanded properties are not translated.

```http
GET /BooksDetails?$expand=authors //> all fields from authors are non-localized defaults, if BooksDetails is annotated with `@cds.localized: false`
```

### Write Operations

Since the corresponding text table is linked through composition, you can use deep inserts or upserts to fill in language-specific texts.

```http
POST <your_service_url>/Entity HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "Some name",
  "description": "Some description",
  "texts": [ {"name": "Ein Name", "description": "Eine Beschreibung", "locale": "de"} ]
}
```

If you want to add a language-specific text to an existing entity, perform a `POST` request to the text table of the entity through navigation.

```http
POST <your_service_url>/Entity(<entity_key>)/texts HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json

{
  {"name": "Ein Name", "description": "Eine Beschreibung", "locale": "de"}
}
```

### Update Operations

To update the language-specific texts of an entity along with the default fallback text, you can perform a deep update as a `PUT` or `PATCH` request to the entity through navigation.

```http
PUT/PATCH <your_service_url>/Entity(<entity_key>) HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "Some new name",
  "description": "Some new description",
  "texts": [ {"name": "Ein neuer Name", "description": "Eine neue Beschreibung", "locale": "de"} ]
}
```

To update a single language-specific text field, perform a `PUT` or a `PATCH` request to the entity's text field via navigation.

```http
PUT/PATCH <your_service_url>/Entity(<entity_key>)/texts(ID=<entity_key>,locale='<locale>')/<field_name> HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json

{
  {"name": "Ein neuer Name"} ]
}
```

::: warning *Note:* <!--  -->
Accepted language codes in the `locale` property need to follow the [BCP 47](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/bcp/bcp47.txt) standard but use __underscore__ (`_`) instead of __hyphen__ (`-`), for example `en_GB`.
:::

### Delete Operations

To delete a locale's language-specific texts of an entity, perform a `DELETE` request to the entity's texts table through navigation. Specify the entity's key and the locale that you want to delete.

```http
DELETE <your_service_url>/Entity(<entity_key>)/texts(ID=<entity_key>,locale='<locale>') HTTP/1.1
```

## Nested Localized Data

The definition of books has a `currency` element that is effectively an association to the `sap.common.Currencies` code list entity, which in turn has localized texts. Find the respective definitions in the reference docs for `@sap/cds/common`, in the section on [Common Code Lists](../cds/common#code-lists).

Upon unfolding, all associations to other entities with localized texts are automatically redirected as follows:

```cds
entity localized.Currencies as select from Currencies AS c {* /*...*/};
entity localized.Books as select from Books AS p mixin {
  // association is redirected to localized.Currencies
  country : Association to localized.Currencies on country = p.country;
} into {* /*...*/};
```

Given that, nested localized data can be easily read with independent fallback logic:

```sql
SELECT from localized.Books {
  ID, title, descr,
  currency.name as currency
} where title like '%pen%' or currency.name like '%land%'
```

In the result sets for this query, values for `title`, `descr`, as well as the `currency` name are localized.

## Adding Initial Data

To add initial data, two _.csv_ files are required. The first _.csv_ file, for example _Books.csv_, should contain all the data in the default language.
The second file, for example _Books_texts.csv_ (please note **_texts** in the file name) should contain the translated data in all other languages your application is using.

For example, _Books.csv_ can look as follows:

::: code-group
```csv [Books.csv]
ID;title;descr;author_ID;stock;price;currency_code;genre_ID
201;Wuthering Heights;Wuthering Heights, Emily Brontë's only novel ...;101;12;11.11;GBP;11

```
:::

This is the corresponding _Books_texts.csv_:
