# Serving Media Data

{{ $frontmatter.synopsis }}


## Annotating Media Elements

You can use the following annotations in the service model to indicate that an element in an entity contains media data.

`@Core.MediaType`
: Indicates that the element contains media data (directly or using a redirect). The value of this annotation is either a string with the contained MIME type (as shown in the first example), or is a path to the element that contains the MIME type (as shown in the second example).

`@Core.IsMediaType`
: Indicates that the element contains a MIME type. The `@Core.MediaType` annotation of another element can reference this element.

`@Core.IsURL @Core.MediaType`
: Indicates that the element contains a URL pointing to the media data (redirect scenario).

`@Core.ContentDisposition.Filename`
: Indicates that the element is expected to be displayed as an attachment, that is downloaded and saved locally. The value of this annotation is a path to the element that contains the Filename (as shown in the fourth example ).

`@Core.ContentDisposition.Type`
: Can be used to instruct the browser to display the element inline, even if `@Core.ContentDisposition.Filename` is specified, by setting to `inline` (see the fifth example). If omitted, the behavior is `@Core.ContentDisposition.Type: 'attachment'`.

::: warning
`@Core.ContentDisposition.Type` is currently only available for the Node.js runtime.
:::


The following examples show these annotations in action:

1. Media data is stored in a database with a fixed media type `image/png`:

```cds
entity Books { //...
  image : LargeBinary @Core.MediaType: 'image/png';
}
```

2. Media data is stored in a database with a _variable_ media type:

```cds
entity Books { //...
  image : LargeBinary @Core.MediaType: imageType;
  imageType : String  @Core.IsMediaType;
}
```

3. Media data is stored in an external repository:

```cds
entity Books { //...
  imageUrl  : String @Core.IsURL @Core.MediaType: imageType;
  imageType : String @Core.IsMediaType;
}
```

4. Content disposition data is stored in a database with a _variable_ disposition:
```cds
entity Authors { //...
  image : LargeBinary @Core.MediaType: imageType @Core.ContentDisposition.Filename: fileName;
  fileName : String;
}
```

5. The image shall have the suggested file name but be displayed inline nevertheless:

```cds
entity Authors { //...
  image : LargeBinary @Core.MediaType: imageType @Core.ContentDisposition.Filename: fileName @Core.ContentDisposition.Type: 'inline';
  fileName : String;
}
```

::: warning
In case you rename the properties holding the media type or content disposition information in a projection, you need to update the annotation's value as well.

## Reading Media Resources

Read media data using `GET` requests of the form `/Entity(<ID>)/mediaProperty`:

```cds
GET ../Books(201)/image
> Content-Type: application/octet-stream
```

> The response's `Content-Type` header is typically `application/octet-stream`.

> Although allowed by [RFC 2231](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2231), Node.js does not support line breaks in HTTP headers. Hence, make sure you remove any line breaks from your `@Core.IsMediaType` content.

Read media data with `@Core.ContentDisposition.Filename` in the model:

```cds
GET ../Authors(201)/image
> Content-Disposition: 'attachment; filename="foo.jpg"'
```

> The media data is streamed automatically.

## Creating a Media Resource

As a first step, create an entity without media data using a POST request to the entity. After creating the entity, you can insert a media property using the PUT method. The MIME type is passed in the `Content-Type` header. Here are some sample requests:

```cds
POST ../Books
Content-Type: application/json
{ <JSON> }
```

```cds
PUT ../Books(201)/image
Content-Type: image/png
<MEDIA>
```

> The media data is streamed automatically.

## Updating Media Resources

The media data for an entity can be updated using the PUT method:

```cds
PUT ../Books(201)/image
Content-Type: image/png
<MEDIA>
```

> The media data is streamed automatically.

## Deleting Media Resources

One option is to delete the complete entity, including all media data:

```cds
DELETE ../Books(201)
```

Alternatively, you can delete a media data element individually:

```cds
DELETE ../Books(201)/image
```

## Using External Resources

The following are requests and responses for the entity containing redirected media data from the third example, "Media data is stored in an external repository".
> This format is used by OData-Version: 4.0. To be changed in OData-Version: 4.01.

```cds
GET: ../Books(201)
>{ ...
    image@odata.mediaReadLink: "http://other-server/image.jpeg",
    image@odata.mediaContentType: "image/jpeg",
    imageType: "image/jpeg"
}
```

## Serving Binary Data in OData Services — Conventions and Limitations

### General Conventions

- Binary data in payloads must be a Base64 encoded string.
- Binary data in URLs must have the format `binary'<url-safe base64 encoded>'`. For example:

```
$filter=ID eq binary'Q0FQIE5vZGUuanM='
```

### Node.js Runtime Conventions and Limitations

- The usage of binary data in some advanced constructs like the `$apply` query option and `/any()` might be limited.
- On SQLite, binary strings are stored as plain strings, whereas a buffer is stored as binary data. As a result, if in
a CDS query, a binary string is used to query data stored as binary, this wouldn't work.
- SAP HANA Database Client for Node.js (HDB) and SAP HANA Client for Node.js (`@sap/hana-client`) packages handle
binary data differently. For example, HDB automatically converts binary strings into binary data, whereas SAP HANA
Client doesn't.
- In the Node.js Runtime, all binary strings are converted into binary data according to SAP HANA property types.
To disable this default behavior, you can set the environment variable `cds.env.hana.base64_to_buffer` to `false`.
