# Data Protection & Privacy

{{ $frontmatter.synopsis }}

## General Statement { #dpp-statement }

Governments place legal requirements on industry to protect data and privacy.

::: tip
No guide, including this one, concerning CAP attempts to give any advice on whether any features and functions are the best method to support company-, industry-, region-, or country-specific requirements. Furthermore, the information provided in this note does not give any advice or recommendations with regards to additional features that might be required in a particular environment. Decisions related to data protection must be made on a case-by-case basis, under consideration of the given system landscape and the applicable legal requirements.

## Data Protection & Privacy in CAP { #dpp-cap }

CAP is a framework that provides modeling and runtime features to enable customers to build business applications on top.
As a framework, in general, CAP doesn't store or manage any personal data on its own with some exceptions:

- Application logging on detailed level written by CAP runtime might contain personal data such as user names and IP addresses. The logs are mandatory to operate the system.
Connect an adequate logging service to meet compliance requirements such as [SAP Application Logging Service](https://help.sap.com/docs/application-logging-service/sap-application-logging-service/sap-application-logging-service-for-cloud-foundry-environment).

- A draft-enabled service `Foo` has an entity `Foo.DraftAdministrativeData` with fields `CreatedByUser`, `InProcessByUser` and `LastChangedByUser` containing personal data for all draft entity instances in edit mode.

- Messages temporarily written to transaction outbox might contain personal data. The entries are mandatory to operate the system.
If necessary, applications can process these messages by standard CAP functionality (CDS model `@sap/cds/srv/outbox`).

- Be aware that personal data might be added automatically when using the [managed](../domain-modeling#managed-data) aspect.

Dependent on the business scenario, custom CDS models served by CAP runtime will most likely contain personal data that is also stored in a backing service.

CAP provides a [rich set of tools](aspects) to protect the application from unauthorized access to business data, including personal data.
Furthermore, it helps applications to provide [higher-level DPP-related functions](#dpp-support) such as data retrieval.

## Data Protection & Privacy Supported by CAP { #dpp-support }
<!-- TODO: Duplicate attribute error with: #SEC-255 #SEC-265 #SEC-254 -->

CAP provides several [features](../data-privacy/) to help applications meet DPP-requirements:

- The [Personal Data Management (PDM)](../data-privacy/pdm) integration has a configurable **retrieval function**, which can be used to inform data subjects about personal data stored related to them.
- CAP also provides a *fully model-driven* approach to track **changes in personal data** or **read access to sensitive personal data** in the audit log.
Having [declared personal data](../data-privacy/annotations) in your model, CAP automatically triggers corresponding [audit log events](../data-privacy/audit-logging).

::: warning
❗ So far, applications have to integrate [SAP Data Retention Manager](https://help.sap.com/docs/DATA_RETENTION_MANAGER) to implement an adequate **erasure function** for personal data out of retention period.
CAP will cover an out-of-the-box integration in the future.
