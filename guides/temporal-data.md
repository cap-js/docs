# Temporal Data

{{ $frontmatter.synopsis }}

Temporal data allows you to maintain information relating to past, present, and future application time.
Built-in support for temporal data follows the general principle of CDS to capture intent with models while staying conceptual, concise, and comprehensive, and minimizing pollution by technical artifacts.

## Starting with 'Timeless' Models {#timeless-model}

For the following explanation, let's start with a base model to manage employees and their work assignments, which is free of any traces of temporal data management.

### Timeless Model

::: code-group
```cds [timeless-model.cds]
namespace com.acme.hr;
using { com.acme.common.Persons } from './common';

entity Employees : Persons {
  jobs : Composition of many WorkAssignments on jobs.empl=$self;
  job1 : Association to one /*of*/ WorkAssignments;
}

entity WorkAssignments {
  key ID  : UUID;
  role    : String(111);
  empl    : Association to Employees;
  dept    : Association to Departments;
}

entity Departments {
  key ID  : UUID;
  name    : String(111);
  head    : Association to Employees;
  members : Association to many Employees on members.jobs.dept = $self;
}

```
:::

> An employee can have several work assignments at the same time.
> Each work assignment links to one department.

### Timeless Data

A set of sample data entries for this model, which only captures the latest state, can look like this:

![Alice has the job a a developer and consultant. Bob is a builder. Alice works in her roles for the departments core development and app development. Bob's work assignment is linked to the construction department.](assets/temporal-data/timeless-data.drawio.svg)

> Italic titles indicate to-one associations; actual names of the respective foreign key columns in SQL are `job1_ID`, `empl_ID`, and `dept_ID`.


## Declaring Temporal Entities

_Temporal Entities_ represent _logical_ records of information for which we track changes over time by recording each change as individual _time slices_ in the database with valid from/to boundaries. For example, we could track the changes of Alice's primary work assignment _WA1_ over time:

![Alice progressed from developer to senior developer to architect.](assets/temporal-data/time-slices.drawio.svg)

::: tip
Validity periods are expected to be **non-overlapping** and **closed-open** intervals; same as in SQL:2011.
:::

### Using Annotations `@cds.valid.from/to`

To track temporal data, just add a pair of date/time elements to the respective entities annotated with `@cds.valid.from/to`, as follows:

```cds
entity WorkAssignments { //...
  start : Date @cds.valid.from;
  end   : Date @cds.valid.to;
}
```
::: tip
The annotation pair `@cds.valid.from/to` actually triggers the built-in mechanisms for [serving temporal data](#serving-temporal-data). It specifies which elements form the **application-time** period, similar to SQL:2011.
:::

### Using Common Aspect `temporal`

Alternatively, use the predefined aspect [`temporal`](../cds/common#aspect-temporal) to declare temporal entities:

```cds
using { temporal } from '@sap/cds/common';
entity WorkAssignments : temporal {/*...*/}
```

Aspect [`temporal`](../cds/common#aspect-temporal) is defined in _[@sap/cds/common](../cds/common)_ as follows:

```cds
aspect temporal {
  validFrom : Timestamp @cds.valid.from;
  validTo   : Timestamp @cds.valid.to;
}
```


### Separate Temporal Details

The previous samples would turn the whole _WorkAssignment_ entity into a temporal one. Frequently though, only some parts of an entity are temporal, while others stay timeless. You can reflect this by separating temporal elements from non-temporal ones:

```cds
entity WorkAssignments {          // non-temporal head entity
  key ID  : UUID;
  empl    : Association to Employees;
  details : Composition of WorkDetails on details.ID = $self.ID;
}
entity WorkDetails : temporal {   // temporal details entity
  key ID  : UUID;                 // logical record ID
  role    : String(111);
  dept    : Association to Departments;
}
```

The data situation would change as follows:

![Alice has two work assignments. Her first work assignment is stable but the roles in this assignment change over time. She progressed from developer to senior developer to architect. Each role has specific validity defined.](assets/temporal-data/temporal-details.drawio.svg)


## Serving Temporal Data

We expose the entities from the following timeless model in a service as follows:

::: code-group
```cds [service.cds]
using { com.acme.hr } from './temporal-model';
service HRService {
  entity Employees as projection on hr.Employees;
  entity WorkAssignments as projection on hr.WorkAssignments;
  entity Departments as projection on hr.Departments;
}
```
:::

> You can omit composed entities like _WorkAssignments_ from the service, as they would get
[auto-exposed](providing-services#auto-exposed-entities) automatically.

## Reading Temporal Data

### As-of-now Queries

READ requests without specifying any temporal query parameter will automatically return data valid _as of now_.

For example, assumed the following OData query to read all employees with their current work assignments is processed on March 2019:

```cds
GET Employees?
$expand=jobs($select=role&$expand=dept($select=name))
```

The values of `$at`, and so also the respective session variables, would be set to, for example:

|              |                                  |                            |
|--------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------|
| `$at.from` = | _session_context('valid-from')_= | _2019-03-08T22:11:00Z_     |
| `$at.to` =   | _session_context('valid-to')_ =  | _2019-03-08T22:11:00.001Z_ |

The result set would be:

```json
[
  { "ID": "E1", "name": "Alice", "jobs": [
    { "role": "Architect", "dept": {"name": "Core Development"}},
    { "role": "Consultant", "dept": {"name": "App Development"}}
  ]},
  { "ID": "E2", "name": "Bob", "jobs": [
    { "role": "Builder", "dept": {"name": "Construction"}}
  ]}
]
```

### Time-Travel Queries

We can run the same OData query as in the previous sample to read a snapshot data as valid on January 1, 2017 using the `sap-valid-at` query parameter:

```cds
GET Employees?sap-valid-at=date'2017-01-01'
$expand=jobs($select=role&$expand=dept($select=name))
```

The values of `$at` and hence the respective session variables would be set to, for example:

|              |                                  |                            |
|--------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------|
| `$at.from` = | _session_context('valid-from')_= | _2017-01-01T00:00:00Z_     |
| `$at.to` =   | _session_context('valid-to')_ =  | _2017-01-01T00:00:00.001Z_ |

The result set would be:

```json
[
    { "ID": "E1", "name": "Alice", "jobs": [
      { "role": "Developer", "dept": {"name": "Core Development"}},
      { "role": "Consultant", "dept": {"name": "App Development"}}
    ]}, ...
]
```
::: warning
Time-travel queries aren't supported on SQLite due to the lack of *session_context* variables.
:::

### Time-Period Queries

We can run the same OData query as in the previous sample to read all history of data as valid since 2016 using the `sap-valid-from` query parameter:

```cds
GET Employees?sap-valid-from=date'2016-01-01'
$expand=jobs($select=role&$expand=dept($select=name))
```

The result set would be:

```json
[
  { "ID": "E1", "name": "Alice", "jobs": [
    { "role": "Developer", "dept": {"name": "App Development"}},
    { "role": "Developer", "dept": {"name": "Core Development"}},
    { "role": "Senior Developer", "dept": {"name": "Core Development"}},
    { "role": "Consultant", "dept": {"name": "App Development"}}
  ]}, ...
]
```

> You would add `validFrom` in such time-period queries, for example:

```cds
GET Employees?sap-valid-from=date'2016-01-01'
$expand=jobs($select=validFrom,role,dept/name)
```
::: warning
Time-series queries aren't supported on SQLite due to the lack of *session_context* variables.
:::
::: tip
Writing temporal data must be done in custom handlers.
:::

### Transitive Temporal Data

The basic techniques and built-in support for reading temporal data serves all possible use cases with respect to as-of-now and time-travel queries. Special care has to be taken though if time-period queries transitively expand across two or more temporal data entities.

As an example, assume that both, _WorkAssignments_ and _Departments_ are temporal:

```cds
using { temporal } from '@sap/cds/common';
entity WorkAssignments : temporal {/*...*/
  dept : Association to Departments;
}
entity Departments : temporal {/*...*/}
```

When reading employees with all history since 2016, for example:

```cds
GET Employees?$sap-valid-from=date'2016-01-01'
$expand=jobs(
  $select=validFrom,role&$expand=dept(
    $select=validFrom,name
  )
)
```

The results for `Alice` would be:

```json
[
  { "ID": "E1", "name": "Alice", "jobs": [
    { "validFrom":"2014-01-01", "role": "Developer", "dept": [
      {"validFrom":"2013-04-01", "name": "App Development"}
    ]},
    { "validFrom":"2017-01-01", "role": "Consultant", "dept": [
      {"validFrom":"2013-04-01", "name": "App Development"}
    ]},
    { "validFrom":"2017-01-01", "role": "Developer", "dept": [
      {"validFrom":"2014-01-01", "name": "Tech Platform Dev"},
      {"validFrom":"2017-07-01", "name": "Core Development"}
    ]},
    { "validFrom":"2017-04-01", "role": "Senior Developer", "dept": [
      {"validFrom":"2014-01-01", "name": "Tech Platform Dev"},
      {"validFrom":"2017-07-01", "name": "Core Development"}
    ]},
    { "validFrom":"2018-09-15", "role": "Architect", "dept": [
      {"validFrom":"2014-01-01", "name": "Tech Platform Dev"},
      {"validFrom":"2017-07-01", "name": "Core Development"}
    ]}
  ]}, ...
]
```

That is, all-time slices for changes to departments since 2016 are repeated for each time slice of work assignments in that time frame, which is a confusing and redundant piece of information. You can fix this by adding an alternative association to departments as follows:

```cds
using { temporal } from '@sap/cds/common';
entity WorkAssignments : temporal {/*...*/
  dept : Association to Departments;
  dept1 : Association to Departments on dept1.id = dept.id
    and dept1.validFrom <= validFrom and validFrom < dept1.validTo;
}
entity Departments : temporal {/*...*/}
```


## Primary Keys of Time Slices

While timeless entities are uniquely identified by the declared primary `key` — we call that the _conceptual_ key in CDS — time slices are uniquely identified by _the conceptual `key` **+** `validFrom`_.

In effect the SQL DDL statement for the _WorkAssignments_ would look like this:

```sql
CREATE TABLE com_acme_hr_WorkAssignments (
    ID : nvarchar(36),
    validFrom : timestamp,
    validTo : timestamp,
    -- ...
    PRIMARY KEY ( ID, validFrom )
)
```

In contrast to that, the exposed API preserves the timeless view, to easily serve as-of-now and time-travel queries out of the box [as described above](#serving-temporal-data):

```xml
<EntityType Name="WorkAssignments">
  <Key>
    <PropertyRef Name="ID"/>
  </Key>
  ...
</EntityType>
```

Reading an explicit time slice can look like this:

```sql
SELECT from WorkAssignments WHERE ID='WA1' and validFrom='2017-01-01'
```

Similarly, referring to individual time slices by an association:

```cds
entity SomeSnapshotEntity {
  //...
  workAssignment : Association to WorkAssignments { ID, validFrom }
}
```
