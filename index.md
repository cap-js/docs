features:
  - title: Focus on Domain, Powered by CDS
    details: CAP places primary focus on domain, by capturing domain knowledge and intent instead of imperative coding â€” that means, What, not How
  - title: Proven Best Practices, Served Out-of-the-Box
    details: CAP provides many generic implementations for recurring tasks and best practices, distilled from proven SAP applications. Benefits are significantly accelerated development, minimized boilerplate code, and increased quality.
  - title: Agnostic Design, Safeguarding Investments
    details: CAP avoids technology lock-ins through higher-level concepts and APIs, which abstract low-level platform features and protocols to a large extent.
