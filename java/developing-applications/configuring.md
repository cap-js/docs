## Profiles and Properties

This section describes how to configure applications. 
CAP Java applications can fully leverage [Spring Boot's](../spring-boot-integration) capabilities for [Externalized Configuration](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/features.html#features.external-config). 
This enables you to define multiple **configuration profiles** for different scenarios, like local development and cloud deployment.

For a first introduction, have a look at our [sample application](https://github.com/sap-samples/cloud-cap-samples-java) and the [configuration profiles](https://github.com/SAP-samples/cloud-cap-samples-java/blob/master/srv/src/main/resources/application.yaml) we added there.

Now, that you're familiar with how to configure your application, start to create your own application configuration. See the full list of [CDS properties](properties) as a reference.

## Using SAP Java Buildpack { #buildpack }

In SAP BTP Cloud Foundry environment, the Java runtime that is used to run your application is defined by the so-called [buildpack](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/buildpacks/). 
For CAP applications, we advise you to use the [SAP Java Buildpack 2](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/sap-jakarta-buildpack).
CAP applications built with Spring Boot don't require any specific configuration for the buildpack and run using [Java Main](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/java-main) runtime by default.

To configure the buildpack for Java 21 with SapMachine JRE, add the following lines to your `mta.yaml` right under your Java service definition: 

```yaml
parameters:
  buildpack: sap_java_buildpack_jakarta
properties:
  JBP_CONFIG_COMPONENTS: "jres: ['com.sap.xs.java.buildpack.jre.SAPMachineJRE']"
  JBP_CONFIG_SAP_MACHINE_JRE: '{ version: 21.+ }'
```

:::warning SAP Business Application Studio
If you develop your application in SAP Business Application Studio and Java 21 is not available there, use the Java 17, instead.

## Service Bindings {#kubernetes-service-bindings}

In the SAP BTP, Kyma Runtime, credentials of service bindings are stored in Kubernetes secrets. Using volumes, you can mount secrets into your application's container. These volumes contain a file for each of the secrets properties.

### Get the Secret into Your Container

To use a Kubernetes secret with your CAP service, you create a volume from it and mount it to the service's container.

*For example:*

```yaml
spec:
  volumes:
    - name: bookshop-db-secret-vol
      secret:
        secretName: bookshop-db-secret
  containers:
  - name: app-srv
    ...
    volumeMounts:
      - name: bookshop-db-secret-vol
        mountPath: /etc/secrets/sapcp/hana/bookshop-db
        readOnly: true
```

### Prepare Your CAP Application

Add the `cds-feature-k8s` feature in the _pom.xml_ file of your CAP application to consume service credentials:

```xml
<dependencies>
	<!-- Features -->
	<dependency>
		<groupId>com.sap.cds</groupId>
		<artifactId>cds-feature-k8s</artifactId>
		<scope>runtime</scope>
	</dependency>
</dependencies>
```

The feature supports reading multiple credentials from a common base directory and to read credentials from arbitrary directories.

### Read Credentials from a Base Directory

The base directory for service credentials is the _/etc/secrets/sapcp_ directory. You can overwrite the default base directory with the `cds.environment.k8s.secretsPath` property.

Within this base directory, the directory structure for the service credentials is _\<service-name\>/\<instance-name\>_.

### Read Credentials from Arbitrary Directories

You can also configure service bindings using the  `cds.environment.k8s.serviceBindings` configuration property.

For example:

```yaml
cds:
  environment:
    k8s:
      serviceBindings:
        bookshop-db:
          secretsPath: /etc/secrets/hana
          service: hana
          plan: hdi-shared
          tags:
           - hana
           - db
        bookshop-uaa:
          secretsPath: /etc/somewhere/else/xsuaa
          ...
```

The parameters `plan` and `tags` are optional.
