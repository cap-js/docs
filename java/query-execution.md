## Query Execution { #queries}

[CDS Query Language (CQL)](./query-api) statements can be executed using the `run` method of any [service that accepts CQN queries](consumption-api.md#cdsservices):

```java
CqnService service = ...

CqnSelect query = Select.from("bookshop.Books")
    .columns("title", "price");

Result result = service.run(query);
```


### Parameterized Execution

Queries, as well as update and delete statements, can be parameterized with _named_, or _indexed parameters_. Update and delete statements with _named_ parameters can be executed in batch mode using multiple parameter sets.

#### Named Parameters

The following statement uses two parameters named *id1* and *id2*. The parameter values are given as a map:

```java
import static com.sap.cds.ql.CQL.param;

CqnDelete delete = Delete.from("bookshop.Books")
    .where(b -> b.get("ID").eq(param("id1"))
            .or(b.get("ID").eq(param("id2"))));

Map<String, Object> paramValues = new HashMap<>();
paramValues.put("id1", 101);
paramValues.put("id2", 102);

Result result = service.run(delete, paramValues);
```
::: warning
The parameter value map **must** be of type `Map<String, Object>`, otherwise the map is interpreted as a single positional/indexed parameter value, which results in an error.
:::

#### Indexed Parameters

The following statement uses two indexed parameters defined through `param(i)`:

```java
import static com.sap.cds.ql.CQL.param;

CqnDelete delete = Delete.from("bookshop.Books")
    .where(b -> b.get("ID").in(param(0), param(1)));

Result result = service.run(delete, 101, 102);
```

Before the execution of the statement the values 101 and 102 are bound to the defined parameters.


#### Batch Execution

Update and delete statements with _named parameters_ can be executed as batch with multiple parameter sets.
The named parameters example from above can be expressed using batch delete with a single parameter and two value sets:

```java
import static com.sap.cds.ql.CQL.param;

CqnDelete delete = Delete.from("bookshop.Books").byParams("ID");

Map<String, Object> paramSet1 = singletonMap("ID", 101);
Map<String, Object> paramSet1 = singletonMap("ID", 102);

Result result = service.run(query, asList(paramSet1, paramSet2));
long deletedRows = result.rowCount();
```

From the result of a batch update/delete the total number of updated/deleted rows can be determined by [rowCount()](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.sap.cds/cds4j-api/latest/com/sap/cds/Result.html#rowCount--), and [rowCount(batchIndex)](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.sap.cds/cds4j-api/latest/com/sap/cds/Result.html#rowCount-int-) returns the number of updated/deleted rows for a specific parameter set of the batch.
The number of batches can be retrieved via the [batchCount()](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.sap.cds/cds4j-api/latest/com/sap/cds/Result.html#batchCount--) method. Batch updates also return the update data.

The maximum batch size for update and delete can be configured via `cds.sql.max-batch-size` and has a default of 1000.


#### Querying Parameterized Views on SAP HANA { #querying-views}

To query [views with parameters](../advanced/hana#views-with-parameters) on SAP HANA, you need to build a select statement and execute it with the corresponding named parameters.

Let's consider the following `Book` entity and a parameterized view that returns the `ID` and `title` of `Books` with number of pages less than `numOfPages`:

```cds
entity Book {
    key ID : Integer;
    title  : String;
    pages  : Integer;
}

entity BookView(numOfPages : Integer) as SELECT FROM Book {ID, title} WHERE pages < :numOfPages;
```

The Java query that returns books with number of pages less than *200*:

```java
CqnSelect query = Select.from("BookView");
Map<String, Object> params = Collections.singletonMap("numOfPages", 200);

Result result = service.run(query, params);
```

#### Adding Query Hints for SAP HANA { #hana-hints}

To add a hint clause to a statement, use the `hints` method and prefix the [SAP HANA hints](https://help.sap.com/docs/HANA_CLOUD_DATABASE/c1d3f60099654ecfb3fe36ac93c121bb/4ba9edce1f2347a0b9fcda99879c17a1.htmlS) with `hdb.`:

```java
CqnSelect query = Select.from(BOOKS).hints("hdb.USE_HEX_PLAN", "hdb.ESTIMATION_SAMPLES(0)");
```
::: warning
Hints prefixed with `hdb.` are directly rendered into SQL for SAP HANA and therefore **must not** contain external input!
:::


### Pessimistic Locking { #pessimistic-locking}

Use database locks to ensure that data returned by a query isn't modified in a concurrent transaction.
_Exclusive_ locks block concurrent modification and the creation of any other lock. _Shared_ locks, however, only block concurrent modifications and exclusive locks but allow the concurrent creation of other shared locks.

To lock data:
1. Start a transaction (either manually or let the framework take care of it).
2. Query the data and set a lock on it.
3. Perform the processing and, if an exclusive lock is used, modify the data inside the same transaction.
4. Commit (or roll back) the transaction, which releases the lock.

To be able to query and lock the data until the transaction is completed, just call a [`lock()`](./query-api#write-lock) method and set an optional parameter `timeout`.

In the following example, a book with `ID` 1 is selected and locked until the transaction is finished. Thus, one can avoid situations when other threads or clients are trying to modify the same data in the meantime:

```java
// Start transaction
// Obtain and set a write lock on the book with id 1
	service.run(Select.from("bookshop.Books").byId(1).lock());
	...
// Update the book locked earlier
	Map<String, Object> data = Collections.singletonMap("title", "new title");
	service.run(Update.entity("bookshop.Books").data(data).byId(1));
// Finish transaction
```

The `lock()` method has an optional parameter `timeout` that indicates the maximum number of seconds to wait for the lock acquisition. If a lock can't be obtained within the `timeout`, a `CdsLockTimeoutException` is thrown. If `timeout` isn't specified, a database-specific default timeout will be used.

The parameter `mode` allows to specify whether an `EXCLUSIVE` or a `SHARED` lock should be set.


### Data Manipulation

The CQN API allows to manipulate data by executing insert, update, delete, or upsert statements.


#### Update

The [update](./query-api) operation can be executed as follows:

```java
Map<String, Object> book = new HashMap<>();
book.put("title", "CAP");

CqnUpdate update = Update.entity("bookshop.Books").data(book).where(b -> b.get("ID").eq(101));
long updateCount = service.run(update).rowCount();
```


### Working with Structured Documents

It's possible to work with structured data as the insert, update, and delete operations cascade along *compositions*.

#### Cascading over Associations { #cascading-over-associations}

By default, *insert*, *update* and *delete* operations cascade over [compositions](../guides/domain-modeling#compositions) only. For associations, this can be enabled using the `@cascade` annotation.
::: warning
Cascading operations over associations isn't considered good practice and should be avoided.
:::

Annotating an *association* with `@cascade: {insert, update, delete}` enables deep updates/upserts through this association.
Given the following CDS model with two entities and an association between them, only *insert* and *update* operations are cascaded through `author`:

```cds
entity Book {
  key ID : Integer;
  title  : String;

  @cascade: {insert, update}
  author : Association to Author;
}

entity Author {
  key ID : Integer;
  name   : String;
}
```

::: warning _❗ Warning_ <!--  -->
For inactive draft entities `@cascade` annotations are ignored.
:::

::: warning _❗ Warning_ <!--  -->
The @cascade annotation is not respected by foreign key constraints on the database. To avoid unexpected behaviour you might have to disable a FK constraint with [`@assert.integrity:false`](../guides/databases#db-constraints).
:::

#### Deep Insert / Upsert { #deep-insert-upsert}

[Insert](./query-api#insert) and [upsert](./query-api#upsert) statements for an entity have to include the keys and (optionally) data for the entity's composition targets. The targets are inserted or upserted along with the root entity.

```java
Iterable<Map<String, Object>> books;

CqnInsert insert = Insert.into("bookshop.Books").entries(books);
Result result = service.run(insert);

CqnUpsert upsert = Upsert.into("bookshop.Books").entries(books);
Result result = service.run(upsert);
```


#### Cascading Delete

The [delete](./query-api) operation is cascaded along the entity's compositions. All composition targets that are reachable from the (to be deleted) entity are deleted as well.

The following example deletes the order with ID *1000* including all its items:

```java
CqnDelete delete = Delete.from("bookshop.Orders").matching(singletonMap("OrderNo", 1000));
long deleteCount = service.run(delete).rowCount();
```

### Resolvable Views and Projections { #updatable-views}

The CAP Java SDK aims to resolve statements on non-complex views and projections to their underlying entity. When delegating queries between Application Services and Remote Services, statements are resolved to the entity definitions of the targeted service. Using the Persistence Service, only modifying statements are resolved before executing database queries. This allows to execute [Insert](./query-api#insert), [Upsert](./query-api#upsert), [Update](./query-api#update), and [Delete](./query-api#delete) operations on database views. For [Select](./query-api#select) statements database views are always leveraged, if available.

Views and projections can be resolved if the following conditions are met:

- The view definition does not use any other clause than `columns` and `excluding`.
- The projection includes all key elements; with the exception of insert operations with generated UUID keys.
- The projection includes all elements with a `not null` constraint, unless they have a default value.
- The projection must not include calculated fields when running queries against a remote OData service.
- The projection must not include [path expressions](../cds/cql#path-expressions) using to-many associations.

For [Insert](./query-api#insert) or [Update](./query-api#update) operations, if the projection contains functions or expressions, these values are ignored. Path expressions navigating *to-one* associations, can be used in projections as shown by the `Header` view in the following example. The `Header` view includes the element `country` from the associated entity `Address`.

```cds
// Supported
entity Order as projection on bookshop.Order;
entity Order as projection on bookshop.Order { ID, status as state };
entity Order as projection on bookshop.Order excluding { status };
entity Header as projection on bookshop.OrderHeader { key ID, address.country as country };
```

If a view is too complex to be resolved by the CDS runtime, the statement remains unmodified. Views that cannot be resolved by the CDS runtime include the use of `join`, `union` and the `where` clause.
- For the Persistence Service, this means the runtime _attempts_ to execute the write operation on the database view. Whether this execution is possible is [database dependent](persistence-services#database-support).
- For Application Services and Remote Services, the targeted service will reject the statement.

Example of a view that can't be resolved:

```cds
// Unsupported
entity DeliveredOrders as select from bookshop.Order where status = 'delivered';
entity Orders as SELECT from bookshop.Order inner join bookshop.OrderHeader on Order.header.ID = OrderHeader.ID { Order.ID, Order.items, OrderHeader.status };
```

### Using I/O Streams in Queries

As described in section [Predefined Types](./data#predefined-types) it's possible to stream the data, if the element is annotated with `@Core.MediaType`. The following example demonstrates how to allocate the stream for element `coverImage`, pass it through the API to an underlying database and close the stream.

Entity `Books` has an additional annotated element `coverImage : LargeBinary`:

```cds
entity Books {
  key ID : Integer;
  title  : String;
  ...
  @Core.MediaType
  coverImage : LargeBinary;
}
```

Java snippet for creating element `coverImage` from file `IMAGE.PNG` using `java.io.InputStream`:

```java
// Transaction started

Result result;
try (InputStream resource = getResource("IMAGE.PNG")) {
    Map<String, Object> book = new HashMap<>();
    book.put("title", "My Fancy Book");
    book.put("coverImage", resource);

    CqnInsert insert = Insert.into("bookshop.Books").entry(book);
    result = service.run(insert);
}

// Transaction finished
```

### Using Native SQL

CAP Java doesn't have a dedicated API to execute native SQL Statements. However, when using Spring as application framework you can leverage Spring's features to execute native SQL statements. See [Execute SQL statements with Spring's JdbcTemplate](./advanced#jdbctemplate) for more details.


## Query Result Processing { #result}

The result of a query is abstracted by the `Result` interface, which is an iterable of `Row`. A `Row` is a `Map<String, Object>` with additional convenience methods and extends [CdsData](./data#cds-data).

You can iterate over a `Result`:

```java
Result result = ...

for (Row row : result) {
  System.out.println(row.get("title"));
}
```

Or process it with the [Stream API](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/?java/util/stream/Stream.html):

```java
Result result = ...

result.forEach(r -> System.out.println(r.get("title")));

result.stream().map(r -> r.get("title")).forEach(System.out::println);
```

If your query is expected to return exactly one row, you can access it with the `single` method:

```java
Result result = ...

Row row = result.single();
```

If it returns a result, like a `find by id` would, you can obtain it using `first`:

```java
Result result = ...

Optional<Row> row = result.first();
row.ifPresent(r -> System.out.println(r.get("title")));
```

The `Row`'s `getPath` method supports paths to simplify extracting values from nested maps. This also simplifies extracting values from results with to-one expands using the generic accessor. Paths with collection-valued segments and infix filters are not supported.

```java
CqnSelect select = Select.from(BOOKS).columns(
     b -> b.title(), b -> b.author().expand()).byId(101);
Row book = dataStore.execute(select).single();

String author = book.getPath("author.name");
```

### Null Values

A result row _may_ contain `null` values for an element of the result if no data is present for the element in the underlying data store.

Use the `get` methods to check if an element is present in the result row:

  ```java
  if (row.get("name") == null) {
     // handle mising value for name
  }
  ```

Avoid using `containsKey` to check for the presence of an element in the result row. Also, when iterating the elements of the row, keep in mind, that the data _may_ contain `null` values:

  ```java
  row.forEach((k, v) -> {
    if (v == null) {
     // handle mising value for element v
    }
 });
  ```

### Typed Result Processing

The element names and their types are checked only at runtime. Alternatively you can use interfaces to get [typed access](data#typed-access) to the result data:

```java
interface Book {
  String getTitle();
  Integer getStock();
}

Row row = ...
Book book = row.as(Book.class);

String title = book.getTitle();
Integer stock = book.getStock();
```

Interfaces can also be used to get a typed list or stream over the result:

```java
Result result = ...

List<Book> books = result.listOf(Book.class);

Map<String, String> titleToDescription =
  result.streamOf(Book.class).collect(Collectors.toMap(Book::getTitle, Book::getDescription));
```

For the entities defined in the data model, CAP Java SDK can generate interfaces for you through [a Maven plugin](./advanced#staticmodel).


### Using Entity References from Result Rows in CDS QL Statements {#entity-refs}

For result rows that contain all key values of an entity, you get an [entity reference](./query-api#entity-refs) via the `ref()` method. This reference addresses the entity via the key values from the result row.

```java
// SELECT from Author[101]
CqnSelect query = Select.from(AUTHOR).byId(101);
Author authorData = service.run(query).single(Author.class);

String authorName = authorData.getName();    // data access
Author_ author    = authorData.ref();        // typed reference to Author[101]
```

Similar for untyped results:

```java
Row authorData = service.run(query).single();
StructuredType<?> author = authorData.ref(); // untyped reference to Author[101]
```

This also works for `Insert` and `Update` results:

```java
CqnUpdate update = Update.entity(AUTHOR).data("name", "James Joyce").byId(101);
Author_ joyce = service.run(update).single(Author.class).ref();
```

Using entity references you can easily write CDS QL statements targeting the source entity:

```java
// SELECT from Author[101].books { sum(stock) as stock }
CqnSelect q = Select.from(joyce.books())
     .columns(b -> func("sum", b.stock()).as("stock"));

CqnInsert i = Insert.into(joyce.books())
     .entry("title", "Ulysses");

CqnUpdate u = Update.entity(joyce.biography())
     .data("price", 29.95);

CqnDelete d = Delete.from(joyce.address())
     .where(b -> b.stock().lt(1));
```

### Introspecting the Row Type

The `rowType` method allows to introspect the element names and types of a query's `Result`. It returns a `CdsStructuredType` describing the result in terms of the [Reflection API](reflection-api):

```java
CqnSelect query = Select.from(AUTHOR)
     .columns(a -> a.name().as("authorName"), a -> a.age());

Result result = service.run(query);

CdsStructuredType rowType = result.rowType();
rowType.elements(); // "authorName", "age"
rowType.getElement("age").getType().getQualifiedName();  // "cds.Integer"
rowType.findElement("ID"); // Optional.empty()
```
