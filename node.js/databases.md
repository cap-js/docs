### <span style="color:grey">srv</span>.begin <i> () → this </i> {:#db-begin }

In case of database services this actually starts the transaction by acquiring a physical connection from the connection pool, and optionally sends a command to the database like `BEGIN TRANSACTION`. 

This method is called automatically by the framework on the first query, so **you never have to call it** in application coding. There are only very rare cases where you'd want to do so, for example to reuse a `tx` object to start subsequent physical transactions after a former `commit` or `rollback`. But this is not considered good practice.

### `InsertResult` (Beta)

- On INSERT, DatabaseServices return an instance of `InsertResult` defined as follows:
  - Iterator that returns the keys of the created entries, for example:
    - Example: `[...result]` -> `[{ ID: 1 }, { ID: 2 }, ...]`
    - In case of `INSERT...as(SELECT...)`, the iterator returns `{}` for each row
  - `affectedRows`: the number inserted (root) entries or the number of affectedRows in case of INSERT into SELECT
  - `valueOf()`: returns `affectedRows` such that comparisons like `result > 0` can be used
    ::: tip
    `===` can’t be used as it also compares the type

### Presets

We support some convenience presets allowing for minimized configuration and sensible out-of-the-box defaults. You may also use them in combination with configuration profiles.

##### HANA Cloud

This is the shortcut:
```json
{
  "cds": {
    "requires": {
      "db": "hana-cloud"
    }
  }
}
```

This is the expanded version:

```json
{
  "cds": {
    "requires": {
      "db": {
        "kind": "hana",
        "deploy-format": "hdbtable"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
##### HANA Cloud for Multitenancy

This is the shortcut:
```json
{
  "cds": {
    "requires": {
      "db": "hana-mt"
    }
  }
}
```

This is the expanded version:

```json
{
  "cds": {
    "requires": {
      "db": {
        "kind": "hana",
        "deploy-format": "hdbtable",
        "vcap": { "label": "service-manager" }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

##### Multitenant SQLite/HANA Stack for Streamlined MTX

This is the shortcut:
```json
{
  "cds": {
    "requires": {
      "db": "sql-mt"
    }
  }
}
```

This is the expanded version:

```json
{
  "cds": {
    "requires": {
      "db": {
        "[development]": "sqlite",
        "[production]": "hana-mt"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Pool

Instead of opening and closing a database connection for every request, we use a pool to reuse connections.
By default, the following [pool configuration](https://www.npmjs.com/package/generic-pool) is used:

```json
{
  "acquireTimeoutMillis": <if (NODE_ENV='production') 1000 else 10000>,
  "evictionRunIntervalMillis": <2 * (idleTimeoutMillis || softIdleTimeoutMillis || 30000)>,
  "min": 0,
  "max": 100,
  "numTestsPerEvictionRun": <(max - min) / 3>,
  "softIdleTimeoutMillis": 30000,
  "idleTimeoutMillis": 30000,
  "testOnBorrow": true,
  "fifo": false
}
```

The _generic-pool_ has a built-in pool evictor, which inspects idle database connections in the pool and destroys them if they are too old.

The following parameters are provided in the pool configuration:

- _acquireTimeoutMillis_: The parameter specifies how much time it is allowed to wait an existing connection is fetched from the pool or a new connection is established.
- _evictionRunIntervalMillis_: The parameter specifies how often to run eviction checks. In case of 0 the check is not run.
- _min_: Minimum number of database connections to keep in pool at any given time.
  ::: warning
  This should be kept at the default 0. Otherwise every eviction run destroys all unused connections older than `idleTimeoutMillis` and afterwards creates new connections until `min` is reached.
  ::: 

- _max_: Maximum number of database connections to keep in pool at any given time.
- _numTestsPerEvictionRun_: Number of database connections to be checked with one eviction run.
- _softIdleTimeoutMillis_: Amount of time database connection may sit idle in the pool before it is eligible for eviction. At least "min" connections should stay in the pool. In case of -1 no connection can get evicted.
- _idleTimeoutMillis_: The minimum amount of time that a database connection may stay idle in the pool before it is eligible for eviction due to idle time.
This parameter supercedes softIdleTimeoutMillis.
- _testOnBorrow_: Should the pool validate the database connections before giving them to the clients?
- _fifo_: If false, the most recently released resources will be the first to be allocated (stack). If true, the oldest resources will be first to be allocated (queue). Default value: false.

Pool configuration can be adjusted by setting the `pool` option as shown in the following example:

```json
{
  "cds": {
    "requires": {
      "db": {
        "kind": "hana",
        "pool": {
          "acquireTimeoutMillis": 5000,
          "min": 0,
          "max": 100,
          "fifo": true
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
::: warning _❗ Warning_
The parameters are very specific to the current technical setup, such as the application environment and database location.
Even though we provide a default pool configuration, we expect that each application provides its own configuration based on its specific needs.

### TCP keepalive with `hdb` {: .impl.beta}

Starting with version `^0.18.3`, the SAP HANA driver `hdb` allows to [configure TCP keepalive behaviour](https://github.com/SAP/node-hdb#tcp-keepalive).
You can set `tcpKeepAliveIdle` on the connection using the environment variable `HDB_TCP_KEEP_ALIVE_IDLE`.
Valid values are a positive number or `false`.
> As the setting must be injected into the credentials that may be received from an external source, for example in the case of multitenancy, the easiest way to do this is via the environment.

## cds.DatabaseService --- UPSERT {:#databaseservice-upsert }
[databaseservice upsert]: #databaseservice-upsert


<!--- {% assign tx = '<span style="color:grey">srv</span>' %} -->


[Upsert](../cds/cqn.md#upsert) updates existing entity records from the given data or inserts new ones if they don't exist in the database.
`UPSERT` statements can be created with the [UPSERT](cds-ql#UPSERT) query API:

```js
UPSERT.into('db.Books')
  .entries({ ID: 4711, title: 'Wuthering Heights', stock: 100 })
```


`UPSERT` queries are translated into DB native upsert statements, more specifically they unfold to an [UPSERT SQL statement](https://help.sap.com/docs/HANA_CLOUD_DATABASE/c1d3f60099654ecfb3fe36ac93c121bb/ea8b6773be584203bcd99da76844c5ed.html) on SAP HANA and to an [INSERT ON CONFLICT SQL statement](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_upsert.html) on SQLite.

The main use case of upsert is data replication.

If upsert data is incomplete only the given values are updated or inserted, which means the `UPSERT` statement has "PATCH semantics".
::: warning
Even if an entity doesn't exist in the database:<br> &rarr; Upsert is **not** equivalent to Insert.
::: 

The following actions are *not* performed on upsert:
 * UUID key values are _not generated_.
 * The `@cds.on.insert` annotation is _not handled_.
 * Elements are _not initialized_ with default values if the element's value is not given.
 * Generic CAP handlers, such as audit logging, are not invoked.

`UPSERT` statements don't have a where clause. The key values of the entity that is upserted are extracted from the data.
::: tip
The upsert data must contain all key elements of the entity.
::: 

::: warning
In contrast to the Java runtime, deep upserts and delta payloads are not yet supported.
