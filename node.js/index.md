# CAP Service SDK for Node.js
Reference Documentation
{ .subtitle}


<!-- % include links-for-node.md %} -->


## Introduction

As an application developer you'd primarily use the Node.js APIs documented herein to implement **domain-specific custom logic** along these lines:

1. Define services in CDS &rarr; see [Cookbook > Providing & Consuming Services](../guides/providing-services/#defining-services)
2. Add service implementations &rarr; [`cds.Service` > Implementations](./services#srv-impls)
3. Register custom event handlers in which &rarr; [`srv.on`/`before`/`after`](./services#event-handlers)
4. Read/write data from other services in which &rarr; [`srv.run`](./services#srv-run) + [`cds.ql`](./cds-ql)
5. ..., i.e. from your primary database &rarr; [`cds.DatabaseService`](./databases)
5. ..., i.e. from other connected services &rarr; [`cds.RemoteService`](./remote-services)
6. Emit and handle asynchronous events &rarr; [`cds.MessagingService`](./messaging)

All the rest is largely handled by the CAP runtime framework behind the scenes.
This especially applies to bootstrapping the [`cds.server`](./cds-serve) and the generic features
provided through [`cds.ApplicationService`](./app-services).

## Conventions

We use the following notations in method signatures:


Read them as follows:

* `param?` — appended question marks denote optional parameters
* &#8674; `result` — solid line arrows: **returns** the given result
* &#8594; `result` — dashed arrows: **returns a _[Promise]_ resolving to** the given result
* `...` — denotes a fluent API, eventually returning/resolving to given result
* _<i>&#8627;</i>_ — denotes subsequent methods to add options in a fluent API
