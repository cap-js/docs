# Remote Services <Concept />

Class `cds.RemoteService` is a service proxy class to consume remote services via different [protocols](/node.js/cds-serve#cds-protocols), like OData or plain REST.

The `cds.RemoteService` configuration allows you to define various options for connecting to remote services.

### CSRF-Token Handling

If the remote system you want to consume requires it, you can enable the new CSRF-token handling of `@sap-cloud-sdk/core` via configuration options `csrf` and `csrfInBatch`. These options allow to configure CSRF-token handling for each remote service separately.

#### Basic Configuration

```json
"cds": {
    "requires": {
        "API_BUSINESS_PARTNER": {
            "kind": "odata",
            "model": "srv/external/API_BUSINESS_PARTNER",
            "csrf": true,
            "csrfInBatch": true
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, CSRF handling is enabled for the `API_BUSINESS_PARTNER` service, for regular requests (`csrf: true`) and requests made within batch operations (`csrfInBatch: true`).

#### Advanced Configuration

Actually `csrf: true` is a convenient preset. If needed, you can further customize the CSRF-token handling with additional parameters:

```json
"cds": {
    "requires": {
        "API_BUSINESS_PARTNER": {
            ...
            "csrf": {  // [!code focus]
              "method": "get",  // [!code focus]
              "url": "..."  // [!code focus]
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Here, the CSRF-token handling is customized at a more granular level:

 - `method`: The HTTP method for fetching the CSRF token. The default is `head`.
 - `url`: The URL for fetching the CSRF token. The default is the resource path without parameters.

### Timeout Handling

The `requestTimeout` setting in the `cds.RemoteService` configuration specifies the maximum duration, in milliseconds (default: 60000),
to wait for a response from the remote service before timing out.

This setting is useful for handling slow responses from remote services, ensuring your application does not hang
indefinitely waiting for a response. It leverages the SAP Cloud SDK to enforce the timeout when requesting the
remote service.

#### Configuration Option

milliseconds (1 minute).

```json
{
  "API_BUSINESS_PARTNER": {
    "kind": "odata",
    "credentials": {
      ...
      "requestTimeout": 1000000 // [!code focus]
    }
  }
}
```
