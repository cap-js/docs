    <em>cds debug</em> [&lt;app&gt;]

    Debug applications running locally or remotely on Cloud Foundry.
    Local applications will be started in debug mode, while remote applications
    are put into debug mode.

    Cloud Foundry space (check with 'cf target').
    SSH access to the app is required (check with 'cf ssh-enabled').

    If no &lt;app&gt; is given, the app in the current working is started
    (with 'cds watch --debug' for Node.js and 'mvn spring-boot:run' for Java).

      the debug host (default: '127.0.0.1')

    <em>-p</em> | <em>--port</em>

      the debug port (default: '9229' for Node.js, '8000' for Java)
