    let result = `Below you can find all rules of the \`@sap/eslint-plugin-cds\` ESLint plugin.

They are grouped by categories [Model Validation](#model-validation) and [Environment](#environment) to help you understand their purpose.

Your standard CDS project configuration turns on a subset of these rules by default, namely the *recommended*
(&nbsp;âœ…&nbsp;) rules to ensure basic standards are met.

## Model Validation

Model Validation rules are used to validate CDS models within projects.
They are used to enforce security, naming conventions, or other best practices.

Note, that while all recommended (&nbsp;âœ…&nbsp;) model rules run with the CLI, only a number of them are
enabled and visible in the editor by default (&nbsp;ðŸ‘€&nbsp;).
::: details
* *In Editor* rules: Rules that are enabled in the editor by default only rely on the current file as their rule context. These are quick to execute and
can react on file changes.
* *Project-based* rules: Rules that are disabled in the editor by default usually rely on a series of (project) files for their rule context or include
slow or expensive processes. These are slow to execute and only run with the CLI.

## Environment

Environment rules are used to check for proper and up-to-date CDS project environments.
These are only run via the command line and are not available in the editor as they often can't be
pinpointed to any particular file.
