# no-deep-sap-cds-import

## Rule Details

You should only import from the top-level `@sap/cds` package. Accessing internal modules or sub-paths is unsafe, as these are not part of the official public API and may change or be removed without notice.
Note that there are very few files that are exempt from that guideline, which will not be marked as error by this rule.

#### Version
This rule was introduced in `@sap/eslint-plugin-cds 4.0.2`.

## Examples

### ✅ &nbsp; Correct example

The following example imports `@sap/cds`:

::: code-group
<<< ../examples/no-deep-sap-cds-import/correct/srv/admin-service.js#snippet{js:line-numbers} [srv/admin-service.js]
:::
<PlaygroundBadge
  name="no-deep-sap-cds-import"
  kind="correct"
  :files="['srv/admin-service.js']"
/>

### ❌ &nbsp; Incorrect example

This example incorrectly performs a deep import of a file within `@sap/cds`:

::: code-group
<<< ../examples/no-deep-sap-cds-import/incorrect/srv/admin-service.js#snippet{js:line-numbers} [srv/admin-service.js]
:::
<PlaygroundBadge
  name="no-deep-sap-cds-import"
  kind="incorrect"
  :files="['srv/admin-service.js']"
/>
