# no-dollar-prefixed-names

## Rule Details

Names must not start with $ to avoid possible shadowing of reserved variables.

## Examples

#### ✅ &nbsp; Correct example

In the following example, all elements names are well defined and do not start with `$`:

::: code-group
<<< ../examples/no-dollar-prefixed-names/correct/db/schema.cds#snippet{cds:line-numbers} [db/schema.cds]
:::
<PlaygroundBadge
  name="no-dollar-prefixed-names"
  kind="correct"
  :rules="{'@sap/cds/no-dollar-prefixed-names': ['error', 'show']}"
  :files="['db/schema.cds']"
/>

#### ❌ &nbsp; Incorrect example

In the next example, the element `$pages` starts with `$` and so the rule will raise an error for this element:

::: code-group
<<< ../examples/no-dollar-prefixed-names/incorrect/db/schema.cds#snippet{cds:line-numbers} [db/schema.cds]
:::
<PlaygroundBadge
  name="no-dollar-prefixed-names"
  kind="incorrect"
  :rules="{'@sap/cds/no-dollar-prefixed-names': ['error', 'show']}"
  :files="['db/schema.cds']"
/>

## Version
This rule was introduced in `@sap/eslint-plugin-cds 2.3.3`.
